Step 1: Understand the Compression Algorithm
Analyze the provided binary crush to understand the compression algorithm.
Reverse engineer the functions used in the binary, focusing on add_char_to_map and serialize_and_output.

Step 2: Recreate the Decompression Algorithm
Based on the reversed algorithm, write a script to decompress the file message.txt.cz.
The decompression involves reading the length of linked lists and the positions of characters in the input file.

Step 3: Implement the Decompression Script
Use struct.unpack to parse the sizes and positions from bytes.
Store the decompressed content in a byte array.
Extract the content to its original form.
