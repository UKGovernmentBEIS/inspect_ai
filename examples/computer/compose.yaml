    # You can vnc into each container by using the following port mapping which will 
    # dynamically bind to host ports. The specific bindings can be found by using 
    # `docker inspect <container_id_or_name>`. This info is included in Running Samples
    # tab. The output will look something like:
    #
    #  service   container   host     url
    #  VNC       5900        61029    vnc://localhost:61029
    #  noVNC     6080        61030    http://localhost:61030?view_only=true&autoconnect=true

    ports:
      - "5900"
      - "6080"
