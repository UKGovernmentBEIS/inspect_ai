    # If you only launch a single container, you can vnc into that container by using
    # the following port mapping
    # ports:
    #   - "5900:5900"
    #   - "6080:6080"

    # If you launch multiple containers, you can vnc into each container by using the
    # following port mapping which will dynamically bind to host ports. The specific
    # bindings can be found by using `docker inspect <container_id_or_name>`. This
    # info is included in Running Samples tab. The output will look something like:
    #
    #  service                  container port            host port                 url
