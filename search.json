    "text": "Basics\n\nReading Data\nUse the evals_df() function to read a dataframe containing a row for each log file:\n# read logs from a given log directory\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import evals_df\nevals_df(\"logs\")   \n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 9 entries, 0 to 8\nColumns: 51 entries, eval_id to score_model_graded_qa_stderr\nThe default configuration for evals_df() reads a predefined set of columns. You can customise column reading in a variety of ways (covered below in Column Definitions).\nUse the samples_df() function to read a dataframe with a record for each sample across a set of log files. For example, here we read all of the samples in the “logs” directory:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import samples_df\n\nsamples_df(\"logs\")\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 408 entries, 0 to 407\nColumns: 13 entries, sample_id to retries\nBy default, sample_df() reads all of the columns in the EvalSampleSummary data structure (12 columns), along with the eval_id for linking back to the parent eval log file.\n\n\nColumn Groups\nWhen reading dataframes, there are a number of pre-built column groups you can use to read various subsets of columns. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    EvalInfo, EvalModel, EvalResults, evals_df\n)\n\nevals_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns=EvalInfo + EvalModel + EvalResults\n)\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 9 entries, 0 to 8\nColumns: 23 entries, eval_id to score_headline_value\nThis dataframe has 23 columns rather than the 51 we saw when using the default evals_df() congiruation, reflecting the explicit columns groups specified.\nYou can also use column groups to join columns for doing analysis or plotting. For example, here we include eval level data along with each sample:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    EvalInfo, EvalModel, SampleSummary, samples_df\n)\n\nsamples_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns=EvalInfo + EvalModel + SampleSummary\n)\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 408 entries, 0 to 407\nColumns: 27 entries, sample_id to retries\nThis dataframe has 27 columns rather than than the 13 we saw for the default samples_df() behavior, reflecting the additional eval level columns. You can create your own column groups and definitions to further customise reading (see Column Definitions for details).\n\n\nFiltering Logs\nThe above examples read all of the logs within a given directory. You can also use the list_eval_logs() function to filter the list of logs based on arbitrary criteria as well control whether log listings are recursive.\nFor example, here we read only log files with a status of “success”:\n# read only successful logs from a given log directory\nlogs = list_eval_logs(\"logs\", filter=lambda log: log.status == \"success\")\nevals_df(logs)\nHere we read only logs with the task name “popularity”:\n# read only logs with task name 'popularity'\ndef task_filter(log: EvalLog) -&gt; bool:\n    return log.eval.task == \"popularity\"\n    \nlogs = list_eval_logs(\"logs\", filter=task_filter)\nevals_df(logs)\nWe can also choose to read a directory non-recursively:\n# read only the logs at the top level of 'logs'\nlogs = list_eval_logs(\"logs\", recursive=False)\nevals_df(logs)\n\n\nParallel Reading\nThe samples_df(), messages_df(), and events_df() functions can be slow to run if you are reading full samples from hundreds of logs, especially logs with larger samples (e.g. agent trajectories).\nOne easy mitigation when using samples_df() is to stick with the default SampleSummary columns only, as these require only a very fast read of a header (the actual samples don’t need to be loaded).\nIf you need to read full samples, events, or messages and the read is taking longer than you’d like, you can enable parallel reading using the parallel option:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    SampleMessages, SampleSummary samples_df, events_df\n)\n\n# we need to read full sample messages so we parallelize\nsamples = samples_df(\n    \"logs\", \n    columns=SampleSummary + SampleMessages,\n    parallel=True \n)\n\n# events require fully loading samples so we parallelize\nevents = events_df(\n    \"logs\",\n    parallel=True\n)\nParallel reading uses the Python ProcessPoolExecutor with the number of workers based on mp.cpu_count(). The workers are capped at 8 by default as typically beyond this disk and memory contention dominate performance. If you wish you can override this default by passing a number of workers explicitly:\nevents = events_df(\n    \"logs\",\n    parallel=16\n)\nNote that the evals_df() function does not have a parallel option as it only does very inexpensive reads of log headers, so the overhead required for parallelisation would most often make the function slower to run.\n\n\nDatabases\nYou can also read multiple dataframes and combine them into a relational database. Imported dataframes automatically include fields that can be used to join them (e.g. eval_id is in both the evals and samples tables).\nFor example, here we read eval and sample level data from a log directory and import both tables into a DuckDb database:\nimport duckdb\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import evals_df, samples_df\n\ncon = duckdb.connect()\ncon.register('evals', evals_df(\"logs\"))\ncon.register('samples', samples_df(\"logs\"))\nWe can now execute a query to find all samples generated using the google provider:\nresult = con.execute(\"\"\"\n    SELECT * \n    FROM evals e\n    JOIN samples s ON e.eval_id = s.eval_id\n    WHERE e.model LIKE 'google/%'\n\"\"\").fetchdf()",

    "section": "Data Preparation",
    "text": "Data Preparation\nAfter reading data frames from log files, there will often be additional data preparation required for plotting or analysis. Some common transformations are provided as built in functions that satisfy the Operation protocol. To apply these transformations, use the prepare() function.\nFor example, if you have used the inspect view bundle command to publish logs to a website, you can use the log_viewer() operation to map log file paths to their published URLs:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    evals_df, log_viewer, model_info, prepare\n)\n\ndf = evals_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, [\n    model_info(),\n    log_viewer(\"eval\", {\"logs\": \"https://logs.example.com\"})\n])\nSee below for details on available data preparation functions.\n\nmodel_info()\nAdd additional model metadata to an eval data frame. For example:\ndf = evals_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, model_info())\nFields added (when available) include:\n\nmodel_organization_name\n\nDisplayable model organization (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n\nmodel_display_name\n\nDisplayable model name (e.g. Gemini Flash 2.5)\n\nmodel_snapshot\n\nA snapshot (version) string, if available (e.g. “latest” or “20240229”)\n\nmodel_release_date\n\nThe model’s release date\n\nmodel_knowledge_cutoff_date\n\nThe model’s knowledge cutoff date\n\n\nInspect includes built in support for many models (based upon the model string in the dataframe). If you are using models for which Inspect does not include model metadata, you may include your own model metadata (see the model_info() reference for additional details).\n\n\ntask_info()\nMap task names to task display names (e.g. “gpqa_diamond” -&gt; “GPQA Diamond”).\ndf = evals_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, [\n    task_info({\"gpqa_diamond\": \"GPQA Diamond\"})\n])\nSee the task_info() reference for additional details.\n\n\nlog_viewer()\nAdd a “log_viewer” column to an eval data frame by mapping log file paths to remote URLs. Pass mappings from the local log directory (or S3 bucket) to the URL where the logs have been publishing using inspect view bundle. For example:\ndf = evals_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, [\n    log_viewer(\"eval\", {\"logs\": \"https://logs.example.com\"})\n])\nNote that the code above targets “eval” (the top level viewer page for an eval). Other available targets include “sample”, “event”, and “message”. See the log_viewer() reference for additional details.\n\n\nfrontier()\nAdds a “frontier” column to each task. The value of the “frontier” column will be True if for the task, the model was the top-scoring model among all models available at the moment the model was released; otherwise it will be False.\nThe frontier() requires scores and model release dates, so must be run after the model_info() operation.\n\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    evals_df, frontier, log_viewer, model_info, prepare\n)\n\ndf = evals_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, [\n    model_info(),\n    frontier()\n])\n\n\n\nscore_to_float()\nConverts one or more score columns to a float representation of the score.\nFor each column specified, this operation will convert the values to floats using the provided value_to_float function. The column value will be replaced with the float value.\n\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    samples_df, frontier, model_info, prepare, score_to_float\n)\n\ndf = samples_df(\"logs\")\ndf = prepare(df, [\n    score_to_float(\"score_includes\")\n])",

    "section": "Column Definitions",
    "text": "Column Definitions\nThe examples above all use built-in column specifications (e.g. EvalModel, EvalResults, SampleSummary, etc.). These specifications exist as a convenient starting point but can be replaced fully or partially by your own custom definitions.\nColumn definitions specify how JSON data is mapped into dataframe columns, and are specified using subclasses of the Column class (e.g. EvalColumn, SampleColumn). For example, here is the definition of the built-in EvalTask column group:\nEvalTask: list[Column] = [\n    EvalColumn(\"task_name\", path=\"eval.task\", required=True),\n    EvalColumn(\"task_version\", path=\"eval.task_version\", required=True),\n    EvalColumn(\"task_file\", path=\"eval.task_file\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"task_attribs\", path=\"eval.task_attribs\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"task_arg_*\", path=\"eval.task_args\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"solver\", path=\"eval.solver\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"solver_args\", path=\"eval.solver_args\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"sandbox_type\", path=\"eval.sandbox.type\"),\n    EvalColumn(\"sandbox_config\", path=\"eval.sandbox.config\"),\n]\nColumns are defined with a name, a path (location within JSON to read their value from), and other options (e.g. required, type, etc.) . Column paths use JSON Path expressions to indicate how they should be read from JSON.\nMany fields within eval logs are optional, and path expressions will automatically resolve to None when they include a missing field (unless the required=True option is specified).\nHere are are all of the options available for Column definitions:\n\nColumn Options\n\n\n\nParameter\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nname\nstr\nColumn name for dataframe. Can include wildcard characters (e.g. task_arg_*) for mapping dictionaries into multiple columns.\n\n\npath\nstr | JSONPath\nPath into JSON to extract the column from (uses JSON Path expressions). Subclasses also implement path handlers that take e.g. an EvalLog and return a value.\n\n\nrequired\nbool\nIs the field required (i.e. should an error occur if it not found).\n\n\ndefault\nJsonValue\nDefault value to yield if the field or its parents are not found in JSON.\n\n\ntype\nType[ColumnType]\nValidation check and directive to attempt to coerce the data into the specified type. Coercion from str to other types is done after interpreting the string using YAML (e.g. \"true\" -&gt; True).\n\n\nvalue\nCallable[[JsonValue], JsonValue]\nFunction used to transform the value read from JSON into a value for the dataframe (e.g. converting a list to a comma-separated str).\n\n\n\nHere are some examples that demonstrate the use of various options:\n# required field\nEvalColumn(\"run_id\", path=\"eval.run_id\", required=True)\n\n# coerce field from int to str\nSampleColumn(\"id\", path=\"id\", required=True, type=str)\n\n# split metadata dict into multiple columns\nSampleColumn(\"metadata_*\", path=\"metadata\")\n\n# transform list[str] to str\nSampleColumn(\"target\", path=\"target\", value=list_as_str),\n\n\nColumn Merging\nIf a column is name is repeated within a list of columns then the column definition encountered last is utilised. This makes it straightforward to override default column definitions. For example, here we override the behaviour of the default sample metadata columns (keeping it as JSON rather than splitting it into multiple columns):\n samples_df(\n     logs=\"logs\",\n     columns=SampleSummary + [SampleColumn(\"metadata\", path=\"metadata\")]\n )\n\n\nStrict Mode\nBy default, dataframes are read in strict mode, which means that if fields are missing or paths are invalid an error is raised and the import is aborted. You can optionally set strict=False, in which case importing will proceed and a tuple containing pd.DataFrame and a list of any errors encountered is returned. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import evals_df\n\nevals, errors = evals_df(\"logs\", strict=False)\nif len(errors) &gt; 0:\n    print(errors)\n\n\nEvals\nEvalColumns defines a default set of roughly 50 columns to read from the top level of an eval log. EvalColumns is in turn composed of several sets of column definitions that you can be used independently, these include:\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEvalInfo\nDescriptive information (e.g. created, tags, metadata, git commit, etc.)\n\n\nEvalTask\nTask configuration (name, file, args, solver, etc.)\n\n\nEvalModel\nModel name, args, generation config, etc.\n\n\nEvalDataset\nDataset name, location, sample ids, etc.\n\n\nEvalConfig\nEpochs, approval, sample limits, etc.\n\n\nEvalResults\nStatus, errors, samples completed, headline metric.\n\n\nEvalScores\nAll scores and metrics broken into separate columns.\n\n\n\n\nMulti-Columns\nThe task_args dictionary and eval scores data structure are both expanded into multiple columns by default:\nEvalColumn(\"task_arg_*\", path=\"eval.task_args\")\nEvalColumn(\"score_*_*\", path=eval_log_scores_dict)\nNote that scores are a two-level dictionary of score_&lt;scorer&gt;_&lt;metric&gt; and are extracted using a custom function. If you want to handle scores a different way you can build your own set of eval columns with a custom scores handler. For example, here we take a subset of eval columns along with our own custom handler (custom_scores_fn) for scores:\nevals_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns=(\n        EvalInfo\n        + EvalModel\n        + EvalResults\n        + ([EvalColumn(\"score_*_*\", path=custom_scores_fn)])\n    )\n)\n\n\nCustom Extraction\nThe example above demonstrates the use of custom extraction functions, which take an EvalLog and return a JsonValue.\nFor example, here is the default extraction function for the the dictionary of scores/metrics:\ndef scores_dict(log: EvalLog) -&gt; JsonValue:\n    if log.results is None:\n        return None\n    \n    metrics: JsonValue = [\n        {\n            score.name: {\n                metric.name: metric.value for metric in score.metrics.values()\n            }\n        }\n        for score in log.results.scores\n    ]\n    return metrics\nWhich is then used in the definition of the EvalScores column group as follows:\nEvalScores: list[Column] = [\n    EvalColumn(\"score_*_*\", path=scores_dict),\n]\n\n\n\nSamples\nThe samples_df() function can read from either sample summaries (EvalSampleSummary) or full sample records (EvalSample).\nBy default, the SampleSummary column group is used, which reads only from summaries, resulting in considerably higher performance than reading full samples.\nSampleSummary: list[Column] = [\n    SampleColumn(\"id\", path=\"id\", required=True, type=str),\n    SampleColumn(\"epoch\", path=\"epoch\", required=True),\n    SampleColumn(\"input\", path=sample_input_as_str, required=True),\n    SampleColumn(\"target\", path=\"target\", required=True, value=list_as_str),\n    SampleColumn(\"metadata_*\", path=\"metadata\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"score_*\", path=\"scores\", value=score_values),\n    SampleColumn(\"model_usage\", path=\"model_usage\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"total_time\", path=\"total_time\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"working_time\", path=\"total_time\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"error\", path=\"error\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"limit\", path=\"limit\"),\n    SampleColumn(\"retries\", path=\"retries\"),\n]\nBy default, only score values are included in the SampleSummary columns. If you want to additional read the score answer, metadata, and explanation then use the SampleScores column group. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    SampleScores, SampleSummary, samples_df\n)\n\nsamples_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns = SampleSummary + SampleScores\n)\nIf you want to read all of the messages contained in a sample into a string column, use the SampleMessages column group. For example, here we read the summary field and the messages:\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import (\n    SampleMessages, SampleSummary, samples_df\n)\n\nsamples_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns = SampleSummary + SampleMessages\n)\nNote that reading SampleMessages requires reading full sample content, so will take considerably longer than reading only summaries.\nWhen you create a samples data frame the eval_id of its parent evaluation is automatically included. You can additionally include other fields from the evals table, for example:\nsamples_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns = EvalModel + SampleSummary + SampleMessages\n)\n\nMulti-Columns\nNote that the metadata and score columns are both dictionaries that are expanded into multiple columns:\nSampleColumn(\"metadata_*\", path=\"metadata\")\nSampleColumn(\"score_*\", path=\"scores\", value=score_values)\nThis might or might not be what you want for your data frame. To preserve them as JSON, remove the _*:\nSampleColumn(\"metadata\", path=\"metadata\")\nSampleColumn(\"score\", path=\"scores\")\nYou could also write a custom extraction handler to read them in some other way.\n\n\nFull Samples\nSampleColumn will automatically determine whether it is referencing a field that requires a full sample read (for example, messages or store). There are five fields in sample summaries that have reduced footprint in the summary (input, metadata, and scores, error, and limit). For these, fields specify full=True to force reading from the full sample record. For example:\nSampleColumn(\"limit_type\", path=\"limit.type\", full=True)\nSampleColumn(\"limit_value\", path=\"limit.limit\", full=True)\nIf you are only interested in reading full values for metadata, you can use full=True when calling samples_df() as shorthand for this:\nsamples_df(logs=\"logs\", full=True)\n\n\nCustom Extraction\nAs with EvalColumn, you can also extract data from a sample using a callback function passed as the path:\ndef model_reasoning_tokens(summary: EvalSampleSummary) -&gt; JsonValue:\n    ## extract reasoning tokens from summary.model_usage\n\nSampleColumn(\"model_reasoning_tokens\", path=model_reasoning_tokens)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample summaries were enhanced in version 0.3.93 (May 1, 2025) to include the metadata, model_usage, total_time, working_time, and retries fields. If you need to read any of these values you can update older logs with the new fields by round-tripping them through inspect log convert. For example:\n$ inspect log convert ./logs --to eval --output-dir ./logs-amended\n\n\n\n\n\nSample IDs\nThe samples_df() function produces a globally unique ID for each sample, contained in the sample_id field. This field is also included in the data frames created by messages_df() and events_df() as a parent sample reference.\nSince sample_id is globally unique, it is suitable for use in tables and views that span multiple evaluations.\nNote that samples_df() also includes id and epoch fields that serve distinct purposes: id references the corresponding sample in the task’s dataset, while epoch indicates the iteration of execution.\n\n\n\nMessages\nThe messages_df() function enables reading message level data from a set of eval logs. Each row corresponds to a message, and includes a sample_id and eval_id for linking back to its parents.\nThe messages_df() function takes a filter parameter which can either be a list of role designations or a function that performs filtering. For example:\nassistant_messages = messages_df(\"logs\", filter=[\"assistant\"])\n\nDefault Columns\nThe default MessageColumns includes MessageContent and MessageToolCalls:\nMessageContent: list[Column] = [\n    MessageColumn(\"role\", path=\"role\", required=True),\n    MessageColumn(\"content\", path=message_text),\n    MessageColumn(\"source\", path=\"source\"),\n]\n\nMessageToolCalls: list[Column] = [\n    MessageColumn(\"tool_calls\", path=message_tool_calls),\n    MessageColumn(\"tool_call_id\", path=\"tool_call_id\"),\n    MessageColumn(\"tool_call_function\", path=\"function\"),\n    MessageColumn(\"tool_call_error\", path=\"error.message\"),\n]\n\nMessageColumns: list[Column] = MessageContent + MessageToolCalls\nWhen you create a messages data frame the parent sample_id and eval_id are automatically included in each record. You can additionally include other fields from these tables, for example:\nmessages = messages_df(\n    logs=\"logs\",\n    columns=EvalModel + MessageColumns             \n)\n\n\nCustom Extraction\nTwo of the fields above are resolved using custom extraction functions (content and tool_calls). Here is the source code for those functions:\ndef message_text(message: ChatMessage) -&gt; str:\n    return message.text\n\ndef message_tool_calls(message: ChatMessage) -&gt; str | None:\n    if isinstance(message, ChatMessageAssistant) and message.tool_calls is not None:\n        tool_calls = \"\\n\".join(\n            [\n                format_function_call(\n                    tool_call.function, tool_call.arguments, width=1000\n                )\n                for tool_call in message.tool_calls\n            ]\n        )\n        return tool_calls\n    else:\n        return None\n\n\n\nEvents\nThe events_df() function enables reading event level data from a set of eval logs. Each row corresponds to an event, and includes a sample_id and eval_id for linking back to its parents.\nBecause events are so heterogeneous, there is no default columns specification for calls to events_df(). Rather, you can compose columns from the following pre-built groups:\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nEventInfo\nEvent type and span id.\n\n\nEventTiming\nStart and end times (both clock time and working time)\n\n\nModelEventColumns\nRead data from model events.\n\n\nToolEventColumns\nRead data from tool events.\n\n\n\nThe events_df() function also takes a filter parameter which can provide a function that performs filtering. For example, to read all model events:\ndef model_event_filter(event: Event) -&gt; bool:\n    return event.event == \"model\"\n\nmodel_events = events_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns=EventTiming + ModelEventColumns,\n    filter=model_event_filter\n)\nTo read all tool events:\ndef tool_event_filter(event: Event) -&gt; bool:\n    return event.event == \"tool\"\n\nmodel_events = events_df(\n    logs=\"logs\", \n    columns=EvalModel + EventTiming + ToolEventColumns,\n    filter=tool_event_filter\n)\nNote that for tool events we also include the EvalModel column group as model information is not directly embedded in tool events (whereas it is within model events).\n\n\nCustom\nYou can create custom column types that extract data based on additional parameters. For example, imagine you want to write a set of extraction functions that are passed a ReportConfig and an EvalLog (the report configuration might specify scores to extract, normalisation constraints, etc.)\nHere we define a new ReportColumn class that derives from EvalColumn:\nimport functools\nfrom typing import Callable\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, JsonValue\n\nfrom inspect_ai.log import EvalLog\nfrom inspect_ai.analysis import EvalColumn\n\nclass ReportConfig(BaseModel):\n    # config fields\n    ...\n\nclass ReportColumn(EvalColumn):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        name: str,\n        config: ReportConfig,\n        extract: Callable[[ReportConfig, EvalLog], JsonValue],\n        *,\n        required: bool = False,\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__(\n            name=name,\n            path=functools.partial(extract, config),\n            required=required,\n        )\nThe key here is using functools.partial to adapt the function that takes config and log into a function that takes log (which is what the EvalColumn class works with).\nWe can now create extraction functions that take a ReportConfig and an EvalLog and pass them to ReportColumn:\n# read dict scores from log according to config\ndef read_scores(config: ReportConfig, log: EvalLog) -&gt; JsonValue:\n    ...\n\n# config for a given report\nconfig = ReportConfig(...)\n\n# column that reads scores from log based on config\nReportColumn(\"score_*\", config, read_scores)",

These work only for their respective model provider (e.g. the “openai” search provider works only for openai/* models).\nExternal providers: \"tavily\", \"exa\", and \"google\". These are external services that work with any model and require separate accounts and API keys. Note that “google” is different from “gemini” - “google” refers to Google’s Programmable Search Engine service, while “gemini” refers to Google’s built-in search capability for Gemini models.\n\nInternal providers will be prioritized if running on the corresponding model (e.g., “openai” provider will be used when running on openai models).

    "text": ".env Files\nWhile we can include all required options on the inspect eval command line, it’s generally easier to use environment variables for commonly repeated options. To facilitate this, the inspect CLI will automatically read and process .env files located in the current working directory (also searching in parent directories if a .env file is not found in the working directory). This is done using the python-dotenv package).\nFor example, here’s a .env file that makes available API keys for several providers and sets a bunch of defaults for a working session:\n\n\n.env\n\nOPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-api-key\nGOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key\n\nINSPECT_LOG_DIR=./logs-04-07-2024\nINSPECT_LOG_LEVEL=warning\n\nINSPECT_EVAL_MAX_RETRIES=5\nINSPECT_EVAL_MAX_CONNECTIONS=20\nINSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\n\nAll command line options can also be set via environment variable by using the INSPECT_EVAL_ prefix.\nNote that .env files are searched for in parent directories, so if you run an Inspect command from a subdirectory of a parent that has an .env file, it will still be read and resolved. If you define a relative path to INSPECT_LOG_DIR in a .env file, then its location will always be resolved as relative to that .env file (rather than relative to whatever your current working directory is when you run inspect eval).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.env files should never be checked into version control, as they nearly always contain either secret API keys or machine specific paths.

    "text": "Example\nBelow we’ll walk through a simple example of using structured output to constrain model output to a Color type that provides red, green, and blue components. If you want to experiment with it further, see the source code in the Inspect GitHub repository.\nImagine first that we have the following dataset:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\n\ncolors_dataset=[\n    Sample(\n        input=\"What is the RGB color for white?\",\n        target=\"255,255,255\",\n    ),\n    Sample(\n        input=\"What is the RGB color for black?\",\n        target=\"0,0,0\",\n    ),\n]\nWe want the model to give us the RGB values for the colors, but it might choose to output these colors in a wide variety of formats—parsing these formats in our scorer could be laborious and error prone.\nHere we define a Pydantic Color type that we’d like to get back from the model:\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass Color(BaseModel):\n    red: int\n    green: int\n    blue: int\nTo instruct the model to return output in this type, we use the response_schema generate config option, using the json_schema() function to produce a schema for our type. Here is complete task definition which uses the dataset and color type from above:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.model import GenerateConfig, ResponseSchema\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate\nfrom inspect_ai.util import json_schema\n\n@task\ndef rgb_color():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=colors_dataset,\n        solver=generate(),\n        scorer=score_color(),\n        config=GenerateConfig(\n            response_schema=ResponseSchema(\n              name=\"color\", \n              json_schema=json_schema(Color)\n            )\n        ),\n    )\nWe use the json_schema() function to create a JSON schema for our Color type, then wrap that in a ResponseSchema where we also assign it a name.\nYou’ll also notice that we have specified a custom scorer. We need this to both parse and evaluate our custom type (as models still return JSON output as a string). Here is the scorer:\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import (\n    CORRECT,\n    INCORRECT,\n    Score,\n    Target,\n    accuracy,\n    scorer,\n    stderr,\n)\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import TaskState\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef score_color():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        try:\n            color = Color.model_validate_json(state.output.completion)\n            if f\"{color.red},{color.green},{color.blue}\" == target.text:\n                value = CORRECT\n            else:\n                value = INCORRECT\n            return Score(\n                value=value,\n                answer=state.output.completion,\n            )\n        except ValidationError as ex:\n            return Score(\n                value=INCORRECT,\n                answer=state.output.completion,\n                explanation=f\"Error parsing response: {ex}\",\n            )\n\n    return score\nThe Pydantic Color type has a convenient model_validate_json() method which we can use to read the model’s output (being sure to catch the ValidationError if the model produces incorrect output).",

That said, Pydantic models are highly recommended as they provide additional parsing and validation which is generally required for scorers.\nThe response_schema generation config option takes a ResponseSchema object which includes the schema and some additional fields:\nfrom inspect_ai.model import ResponseSchema\nfrom inspect_ai.util import json_schema\n\nconfig = GenerateConfig(\n  response_schema=ResponseSchema(\n    name=\"color\",                   # required name field \n    json_schema=json_schema(Color), # schema for custom type\n    description=\"description\",      # optional field with more context\n    strict=False                    # force model to adhere to schema\n  )\n)\nNote that not all model providers support all of these options. In particular, only the Mistral and OpenAI providers support the name, description, and strict fields (the Google provider takes the json_schema only).\nYou should therefore never assume that specifying strict gets your scorer off the hook for parsing and validating the model output as some models won’t respect strict.

    "text": "Field Mapping\nIf your dataset contains inputs and targets that don’t use input and target as field names, you can map them into a Dataset using a FieldSpec. This same mechanism also enables you to collect arbitrary additional fields into the Sample metadata bucket. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import FieldSpec, json_dataset\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\n    \"popularity.jsonl\",\n    FieldSpec(\n        input=\"question\",\n        target=\"answer_matching_behavior\",\n        id=\"question_id\",\n        metadata=[\"label_confidence\"],\n    ),\n)\nIf you need to do more than just map field names and actually do custom processing of the data, you can instead pass a function which takes a record (represented as a dict) from the underlying file and returns a Sample. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample, json_dataset\n\ndef record_to_sample(record):\n    return Sample(\n        input=record[\"question\"],\n        target=record[\"answer_matching_behavior\"].strip(),\n        id=record[\"question_id\"],\n        metadata={\n            \"label_confidence\": record[\"label_confidence\"]\n        }\n    )\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\"popularity.jsonl\", record_to_sample)\n\nTyped Metadata\nIf you want a more strongly typed interface to sample metadata, you can define a Pydantic model and use it to both validate and read metadata.\nFor validation, pass a BaseModel derived class in the FieldSpec. The interface to metadata is read-only so you must also specify frozen=True. For example:\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclass PopularityMetadata(BaseModel, frozen=True):\n    category: str\n    label_confidence: float\n\ndataset = json_dataset(\n    \"popularity.jsonl\",\n    FieldSpec(\n        input=\"question\",\n        target=\"answer_matching_behavior\",\n        id=\"question_id\",\n        metadata=PopularityMetadata,\n    ),\n)\nTo read metadata in a typesafe fashion, use the metadata_as() method on Sample or TaskState:\nmetadata = state.metadata_as(PopularityMetadata)\nNote again that the intended semantics of metadata are read-only, so attempting to write into the returned metadata will raise a Pydantic FrozenInstanceError.\nIf you need per-sample mutable data, use the sample store, which also supports typing using Pydantic models.",

ReAct is the most common architecture used in agent frameworks and is the baseline against which you should measure more complex agents (it can be surprisingly difficult to hand-tune agents that perform better than a ReAct agent against a diverse set of tasks!).\nThe react() agent provides the following built-in capabilities:\n\nIt runs a tool loop until the model calls a special submit() tool indicating it is done. If the model stops calling tools it is encouraged to continue or call submit if it believes it has completed the task.\nIt optionally supports multiple attempts by invoking the default scorer for the task.

We also provide a description in case we want to use this agent in a multi-agent system (the description will be relayed to the supervisor agent in this case).\nWe can use this in a Task definition just like a Solver:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, eval\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import json_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=json_dataset(\"ctf_challenge.json\"),\n    solver=ctf_agent(),\n    scorer=includes()\n)\n\neval(task, model=\"openai/gpt-4o\")\n\n\n\nIn the examples above we provide a prompt to the agent. This prompt is layered with other default prompt(s) to compose the final system prompt. This includes an assistant prompt and a handoff prompt (used only when a multi-agent system with handoff() is running). Here is the default assistant prompt:\nDEFAULT_ASSISTANT_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a helpful assistant attempting to submit the best possible answer.\nYou have several tools available to help with finding the answer. You will\nsee the result of tool calls right after sending the message. If you need\nto perform multiple actions, you can always send more messages with additional\ntool calls. Do some reasoning before your actions, describing what tool calls\nyou are going to use and how they fit into your plan.\n\nWhen you have completed the task and have an answer, call the {submit}()\ntool to report it.\n\"\"\"\nYou can modify the default prompts by passing an AgentPrompt instance rather than a str. For example:\nreact(\n    description=\"Expert at completing cybersecurity challenges.\",\n    prompt=AgentPrompt(\n        instructions=PROMPT,\n        assistant_prompt=\"&lt;custom assistant prompt&gt;\"\n    ),\n    tools=[bash_session(), text_editor()],\n    attempts=attempts,\n)\nNote that if you want to provide the entire prompt (suppressing all default prompts) then pass an instance of AgentPrompt with instructions and the other parts of the default prompt you want to exclude set to None. For example:\nreact(\n    description=\"Expert at completing cybersecurity challenges.\",\n    prompt=AgentPrompt(\n        instructions=PROMPT,\n        handoff_prompt=None,\n        assistant_prompt=None,\n        submit_prompt=None\n    ),\n    tools=[bash_session(), text_editor()],\n    attempts=attempts,\n)\n\n\n\nWhen using a submit() tool, the react() agent is allowed a single attempt by default. If you want to give it multiple attempts, pass another value to attempts:\nreact(\n    ...\n    attempts=3,\n)\nSubmissions are evaluated using the task’s main scorer, with value of 1.0 indicating a correct answer. You can further customize how attempts works by passing an instance of AgentAttempts rather than an integer (this enables you to set a custom incorrect message, including a dynamically generated one, and also lets you customize how score values are converted to a numeric scale).\n\n\n\nIn some cases models in a tool use loop will simply fail to call a tool (or just talk about calling the submit() tool but not actually call it!). This is typically an oversight, and models simply need to be encouraged to call submit() or alternatively continue if they haven’t yet completed the task.\nThis behaviour is controlled by the on_continue parameter, which by default yields the following user message to the model:\nPlease proceed to the next step using your best judgement. \nIf you believe you have completed the task, please call the \n`submit()` tool with your final answer,\nYou can pass a different continuation message, or alternatively pass an AgentContinue function that can dynamically determine both whether to continue and what the message is. Here is how on_continue affects the agent loop for various inputs:\n\nNone: A default user message will be appended only when there are no tool calls made by the model.\nstr: The returned user message will be appended only when there are no tool calls made by the model.\nCallable: the function passed can return one of:\n\nTrue: Agent loop continues with no messages appended.\nFalse: Agent loop is exited early.\nstr: Agent loop continues and the returned user message will be appended regardless of whether a tool call was made in the previous assistant message. If your custom function only wants to append a message when there are no tool calls made then you should check state.output.message.tool_calls explicitly (returning True rather than str when you want no message appended).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described above, the react() agent uses a special submit() tool internally to enable the model to signal explicitly when it is complete and has an answer. The use of a submit() tool has a couple of benefits:\n\nSome implementations of ReAct loops terminate the loop when the model stops calling tools. However, in some cases models will unintentionally stop calling tools (e.g. write a message saying they are going to call a tool and then not do it). The use of an explicit submit() tool call to signal completion works around this problem, as the model can be encouraged to keep calling tools rather than terminating.\nAn explicit submit() tool call to signal completion enables the implementation of multiple attempts, which is often a good way to model the underlying domain (e.g. a engineer can attempt to fix a bug multiple times with tests providing feedback on success or failure).\n\nThat said, the submit() tool might not be appropriate for every domain or agent. You can disable the use of the submit tool with:\nreact(\n    ...,\n    submit=False\n)\nBy default, disabling the submit tool will result in the agent terminating when it stops calling tools. Alternatively, you can manually control termination by providing a custom on_continue handler.\n\n\n\nIf your agent runs for long enough, it may end up filling the entire model context window. By default, this will cause the agent to terminate (with a log message indicating the reason). Alternatively, you can specify that the conversation should be truncated and the agent loop continue.\nThis behavior is controlled by the truncation parameter (which is \"disabled\" by default, doing no truncation). To perform truncation, specify either \"auto\" (which reduces conversation size by roughly 30%) or pass a custom MessageFilter function. For example:\nreact(... truncation=\"auto\")\nreact(..., truncation=custom_truncation)\nThe default \"auto\" truncation scheme calls the trim_messages() function with a preserve ratio of 0.7.\nNote that if you enable truncation then a message limit may not work as expected because truncation will remove old messages, potentially keeping the conversation length below your message limit. In this case you can also consider applying a time limit and/or token limit.\n\n\n\nThe model parameter to react() agent lets you specify an alternate model to use for the agent loop (if not specified then the default model for the evaluation is used). In some cases you might want to do something fancier than just call a model (e.g. do a “best of n” sampling an pick the best response). Pass a Agent as the model parameter to implement this type of custom scheme. For example:\n@agent\ndef best_of_n(n: int, discriminator: str | Model):\n\n    async def execute(state: AgentState, tools: list[Tool]):\n        # resolve model\n        discriminator = get_model(discriminator)\n\n        # sample from the model `n` times then use the\n        # `discriminator` to pick the best response and return it\n\n        return state\n\n    return execute\nNote that when you pass an Agent as the model it must include a tools parameter so that the ReAct agent can forward its tools.",

Here is how on_continue affects the agent loop for various inputs:\n\nNone: A default user message will be appended only when there are no tool calls made by the model.\nstr: The returned user message will be appended only when there are no tool calls made by the model.\nCallable: the function passed can return one of:\n\nTrue: Agent loop continues with no messages appended.\nFalse: Agent loop is exited early.\nstr: Agent loop continues and the returned user message will be appended regardless of whether a tool call was made in the previous assistant message. If your custom function only wants to append a message when there are no tool calls made then you should check state.output.message.tool_calls explicitly (returning True rather than str when you want no message appended).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs described above, the react() agent uses a special submit() tool internally to enable the model to signal explicitly when it is complete and has an answer. The use of a submit() tool has a couple of benefits:\n\nSome implementations of ReAct loops terminate the loop when the model stops calling tools. However, in some cases models will unintentionally stop calling tools (e.g. write a message saying they are going to call a tool and then not do it). The use of an explicit submit() tool call to signal completion works around this problem, as the model can be encouraged to keep calling tools rather than terminating.\nAn explicit submit() tool call to signal completion enables the implementation of multiple attempts, which is often a good way to model the underlying domain (e.g. a engineer can attempt to fix a bug multiple times with tests providing feedback on success or failure).\n\nThat said, the submit() tool might not be appropriate for every domain or agent. You can disable the use of the submit tool with:\nreact(\n    ...,\n    submit=False\n)\nBy default, disabling the submit tool will result in the agent terminating when it stops calling tools. Alternatively, you can manually control termination by providing a custom on_continue handler.\n\n\n\nIf your agent runs for long enough, it may end up filling the entire model context window. By default, this will cause the agent to terminate (with a log message indicating the reason). Alternatively, you can specify that the conversation should be truncated and the agent loop continue.\nThis behavior is controlled by the truncation parameter (which is \"disabled\" by default, doing no truncation). To perform truncation, specify either \"auto\" (which reduces conversation size by roughly 30%) or pass a custom MessageFilter function. For example:\nreact(... truncation=\"auto\")\nreact(..., truncation=custom_truncation)\nThe default \"auto\" truncation scheme calls the trim_messages() function with a preserve ratio of 0.7.\nNote that if you enable truncation then a message limit may not work as expected because truncation will remove old messages, potentially keeping the conversation length below your message limit. In this case you can also consider applying a time limit and/or token limit.\n\n\n\nThe model parameter to react() agent lets you specify an alternate model to use for the agent loop (if not specified then the default model for the evaluation is used). In some cases you might want to do something fancier than just call a model (e.g. do a “best of n” sampling an pick the best response). Pass a Agent as the model parameter to implement this type of custom scheme. For example:\n@agent\ndef best_of_n(n: int, discriminator: str | Model):\n\n    async def execute(state: AgentState, tools: list[Tool]):\n        # resolve model\n        discriminator = get_model(discriminator)\n\n        # sample from the model `n` times then use the\n        # `discriminator` to pick the best response and return it\n\n        return state\n\n    return execute\nNote that when you pass an Agent as the model it must include a tools parameter so that the ReAct agent can forward its tools.",

    "text": "Web Search\nThe web_search() tool provides models the ability to enhance their context window by performing a search. Web searches are executed using a provider. Providers are split into two categories:\n\nInternal providers: \"openai\", \"anthropic\", \"gemini\", \"grok\", and \"perplexity\" - these use the model’s built-in search capability and do not require separate API keys. These work only for their respective model provider (e.g. the “openai” search provider works only for openai/* models).\nExternal providers: \"tavily\", \"exa\", and \"google\". These are external services that work with any model and require separate accounts and API keys. Note that “google” is different from “gemini” - “google” refers to Google’s Programmable Search Engine service, while “gemini” refers to Google’s built-in search capability for Gemini models.\n\nInternal providers will be prioritized if running on the corresponding model (e.g., “openai” provider will be used when running on openai models). If an internal provider is specified but the evaluation is run with a different model, a fallback external provider must also be specified.\nYou can configure the web_search() tool in various ways:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import web_search\n\n# single provider\nweb_search(\"tavily\")\n\n# internal provider and fallback\nweb_search([\"openai\", \"tavily\"])\n\n# multiple internal providers and fallback\nweb_search([\"openai\", \"anthropic\", \"gemini\", \"perplexity\", \"tavily\"])\n\n# provider with specific options\nweb_search({\"tavily\": {\"max_results\": 5}})\n\n# multiple providers with options\nweb_search({\n    \"openai\": True, \n    \"google\": {\"num_results\": 5}, \n    \"tavily\": {\"max_results\": 5}\n})\n\nOpenAI Options\nThe web_search() tool can use OpenAI’s built-in search capability when running on a limited number of OpenAI models (currently “gpt-4o”, “gpt-4o-mini”, and “gpt-4.1”). This provider does not require any API keys beyond what’s needed for the model itself.\nFor more details on OpenAI’s web search parameters, see OpenAI Web Search Documentation.\nNote that when using the “openai” provider, you should also specify a fallback external provider (like “tavily”, “exa”, or “google”) if you are also running the evaluation with non-OpenAI model.\n\n\nAnthropic Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Anthropic’s built-in search capability when running on a limited number of Anthropic models (currently “claude-opus-4-20250514”, “claude-sonnet-4-20250514”, “claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219”, “claude-3-5-sonnet-latest”, “claude-3-5-haiku-latest”). This provider does not require any API keys beyond what’s needed for the model itself.\nFor more details on Anthropic’s web search parameters, see Anthropic Web Search Documentation.\nNote that when using the “anthropic” provider, you should also specify a fallback external provider (like “tavily”, “exa”, or “google”) if you are also running the evaluation with non-Anthropic model.\n\n\nGemini Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Google’s built-in search capability (called grounding) when running on Gemini 2.0 models and later. This provider does not require any API keys beyond what’s needed for the model itself.\nThis is distinct from the “google” provider (described below), which uses Google’s external Programmable Search Engine service and requires separate API keys.\nFor more details, see Grounding with Google Search.\nNote that when using the “gemini” provider, you should also specify a fallback external provider (like “tavily”, “exa”, or “google”) if you are also running the evaluation with non-Gemini models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nGoogle’s search grounding does not currently support use with other tools. Attempting to use web_search(\"gemini\") alongside other tools will result in an error.\n\n\n\n\nGrok Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Grok’s built-in live search capability when running on Grok 3.0 models and later. This provider does not require any API keys beyond what’s needed for the model itself.\nFor more details, see Live Search.\nNote that when using the “grok” provider, you should also specify a fallback external provider (like “tavily”, “exa”, or “google”) if you are also running the evaluation with non-Grok models.\n\n\nPerplexity Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Perplexity’s built-in search capability when running on Perplexity models. This provider does not require any API keys beyond what’s needed for the model itself. Search parameters can be passed using the perplexity provider options and will be forwarded to the model API.\nFor more details, see Perplexity API Documentation.\nNote that when using the “perplexity” provider, you should also specify a fallback external provider (like “tavily”, “exa”, or “google”) if you are also running the evaluation with non-Perplexity models.\n\n\nTavily Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Tavily’s Research API. To use it you will need to set up your own Tavily account. Then, ensure that the following environment variable is defined:\n\nTAVILY_API_KEY — Tavily Research API key\n\nTavily supports the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmax_results\nNumber of results to return\n\n\nsearch_depth\nCan be “basic” or “advanced”\n\n\ntopic\nCan be “general” or “news”\n\n\ninclude_domains / exclude_domains\nLists of domains to include or exclude\n\n\ntime_range\nTime range for search results (e.g., “day”, “week”, “month”)\n\n\nmax_connections\nMaximum number of concurrent connections\n\n\n\nFor more options, see the Tavily API Documentation.\n\n\nExa Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Exa’s Answer API. To use it you will need to set up your own Exa account. Then, ensure that the following environment variable is defined:\n\nEXA_API_KEY — Exa API key\n\nExa supports the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntext\nWhether to include text content in citations (defaults to true)\n\n\nmodel\nLLM model to use for generating the answer (“exa” or “exa-pro”)\n\n\nmax_connections\nMaximum number of concurrent connections\n\n\n\nFor more details, see the Exa API Documentation.\n\n\nGoogle Options\nThe web_search() tool can use Google Programmable Search Engine as an external provider. This is different from the “gemini” provider (described above), which uses Google’s built-in search capability for Gemini models.\nTo use the “google” provider you will need to set up your own Google Programmable Search Engine and also enable the Programmable Search Element Paid API. Then, ensure that the following environment variables are defined:\n\nGOOGLE_CSE_ID — Google Custom Search Engine ID\nGOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY — Google API key used to enable the Search API\n\nGoogle supports the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnum_results\nThe number of relevant webpages whose contents are returned\n\n\nmax_provider_calls\nNumber of times to retrieve more links in case previous ones were irrelevant (defaults to 3)\n\n\nmax_connections\nMaximum number of concurrent connections (defaults to 10)\n\n\nmodel\nModel to use to determine if search results are relevant (defaults to the model being evaluated)",

To use it with a task you need to reference the aisiuk/inspect-computer-tool image in your Docker compose file. For example:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: aisiuk/inspect-computer-tool\n\nYou can configure the container to not have Internet access as follows:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: aisiuk/inspect-computer-tool\n    network_mode: none\n\nNote that if you’d like to be able to view the model’s interactions with the computer desktop in realtime, you will need to also do some port mapping to enable a VNC connection with the container. See the VNC Client section below for details on how to do this.\nThe aisiuk/inspect-computer-tool image is based on the ubuntu:22.04 image and includes the following additional applications pre-installed:\n\nFirefox\nVS Code\nXpdf\nXpaint\ngalculator\n\n\n\nTask Setup\nA task configured to use the computer tool might look like this:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import match\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import computer\n\n@task\ndef computer_task():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            use_tools([computer()]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        scorer=match(),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"compose.yaml\"),\n    )\nTo evaluate the task with models tuned for computer use:\ninspect eval computer.py --model anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest\ninspect eval computer.py --model openai/computer-use-preview\n\nOptions\nThe computer tool supports the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmax_screenshots\nThe maximum number of screenshots to play back to the model as input.

This requires some additional port-mapping in the Docker compose file. You can define dynamic port ranges for VNC (5900) and a browser based noVNC client (6080) with the following ports entries:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: aisiuk/inspect-computer-tool\n    ports:\n      - \"5900\"\n      - \"6080\"\n\nTo connect to the container for a given sample, locate the sample in the Running Samples UI and expand the sample info panel at the top:\n\nClick on the link for the noVNC browser client, or use a native VNC client to connect to the VNC port. Note that the VNC server will take a few seconds to start up so you should give it some time and attempt to reconnect as required if the first connection fails.\nThe browser based client provides a view-only interface. If you use a native VNC client you should also set it to “view only” so as to not interfere with the model’s use of the computer. For example, for Real VNC Viewer:\n\n\n\nApproval\nIf the container you are using is connected to the Internet, you may want to configure human approval for a subset of computer tool actions. Here are the possible actions (specified using the action parameter to the computer tool):\n\nkey: Press a key or key-combination on the keyboard.\ntype: Type a string of text on the keyboard.\ncursor_position: Get the current (x, y) pixel coordinate of the cursor on the screen.\nmouse_move: Move the cursor to a specified (x, y) pixel coordinate on the screen.\nExample: execute(action=“mouse_move”, coordinate=(100, 200))\nleft_click: Click the left mouse button.\nleft_click_drag: Click and drag the cursor to a specified (x, y) pixel coordinate on the screen.\nright_click: Click the right mouse button.\nmiddle_click: Click the middle mouse button.\ndouble_click: Double-click the left mouse button.\nscreenshot: Take a screenshot.\n\nHere is an approval policy that requires approval for key combos (e.g. Enter or a shortcut) and mouse clicks:\n\n\napproval.yaml\n\napprovers:\n  - name: human\n    tools:\n      - computer(action='key'\n      - computer(action='left_click'\n      - computer(action='middle_click'\n      - computer(action='double_click'\n\n  - name: auto\n    tools: \"*\"\n\nNote that since this is a prefix match and there could be other arguments, we don’t end the tool match pattern with a parentheses.\nYou can apply this policy using the --approval command line option:\ninspect eval computer.py --approval approval.yaml\n\n\nTool Binding\nThe computer tool’s schema is a superset of the standard Anthropic and Open AI computer tool schemas. When using models tuned for computer use (currently anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest and openai/computer-use-preview) the computer tool will automatically bind to the native computer tool definitions (as this presumably provides improved performance).\nIf you want to experiment with bypassing the native computer tool types and just register the computer tool as a normal function based tool then specify the --no-internal-tools generation option as follows:\ninspect eval computer.py --no-internal-tools",

    "text": "Think\nThe think() tool provides models with the ability to include an additional thinking step as part of getting to its final answer.\nNote that the think() tool is not a substitute for reasoning and extended thinking, but rather an an alternate way of letting models express thinking that is better suited to some tool use scenarios.\n\nUsage\nYou should read the original think tool article in its entirely to understand where and where not to use the think tool. In summary, good contexts for the think tool include:\n\nTool output analysis. When models need to carefully process the output of previous tool calls before acting and might need to backtrack in its approach;\nPolicy-heavy environments. When models need to follow detailed guidelines and verify compliance; and\nSequential decision making. When each action builds on previous ones and mistakes are costly (often found in multi-step domains).\n\nUse the think() tool alongside other tools like this:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, system_message, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash_session, text_editor, think\n\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([\n                bash_session(timeout=180),\n                text_editor(timeout=180),\n                think()\n            ]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"compose.yaml\")\n    )\n\n\nTool Description\nIn the original think tool article (which was based on experimenting with Claude) they found that providing clear instructions on when and how to use the think() tool for the particular problem domain it is being used within could sometimes be helpful. For example, here’s the prompt they used with SWE-Bench:\nfrom textwrap import dedent\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, system_message, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash_session, text_editor, think\n\n@task\ndef swe_bench():\n\n    tools = [\n        bash_session(timeout=180),\n        text_editor(timeout=180),  \n        think(dedent(\"\"\"\n            Use the think tool to think about something. It will not obtain\n            new information or make any changes to the repository, but just \n            log the thought. Use it when complex reasoning or brainstorming\n            is needed. For example, if you explore the repo and discover\n            the source of a bug, call this tool to brainstorm several unique\n            ways of fixing the bug, and assess which change(s) are likely to \n            be simplest and most effective. Alternatively, if you receive\n            some test results, call this tool to brainstorm ways to fix the\n            failing tests.\n        \"\"\"))\n    ])\n\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools(tools),\n            generate(),\n        ),\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"compose.yaml\")\n    )\n\n\nSystem Prompt\nIn the article they also found that when tool instructions are long and/or complex, including instructions about the think() tool in the system prompt can be more effective than placing them in the tool description itself.\nHere’s an example of moving the custom think() prompt into the system prompt (note that this was not done in the article’s SWE-Bench experiment, this is merely an example):\nfrom textwrap import dedent\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, system_message, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash_session, text_editor, think\n\n@task\ndef swe_bench():\n\n    think_system_message = system_message(dedent(\"\"\"\n        Use the think tool to think about something.

    "text": "Running Eval Sets\nRun a set of evaluations using the inspect eval-set command or eval_set() function. For example:\n$ inspect eval-set mmlu.py mathematics.py \\\n   --model openai/gpt-4o,anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 \\\n   --log-dir logs-run-42\nOr equivalently:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval_set\n\nsuccess, logs = eval_set(\n   tasks=[\"mmlu.py\", \"mathematics.py\"],\n   model=[\"openai/gpt-4o\", \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\"      \n)\nNote that in both cases we specified a custom log directory—this is actually a requirement for eval sets, as it provides a scope where completed work can be tracked.\nThe eval_set() function returns a tuple of bool (whether all tasks completed successfully) and a list of EvalLog headers (i.e. raw sample data is not included in the logs returned).\n\nRe-Running\nEval sets that don’t complete due to errors or cancellation can be re-run—simply re-execute the same command and any work not yet completed will be scheduled (if the eval set is already done then a message to that effect will be printed).\nYou can also amend an eval set with additional tasks, models, or epochs. Just re-issue the same command with the additions. For example, here we add a model and 2 more epochs to the eval set run in the example from above:\n$ inspect eval-set mmlu.py mathematics.py \\\n   --model openai/gpt-5,openai/gpt-4o,anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620 \\\n   --epochs 3\n   --log-dir logs-run-42\n\n\nConcurrency\nBy default, eval_set() will run multiple tasks in parallel, using the greater of 4 and the number of models being evaluated as the default max_tasks. The eval set scheduler will always attempt to balance active tasks across models so that contention for a single model provider is minimized.\nUse the max_tasks option to override the default behavior:\neval_set(\n   tasks=[\"mmlu.py\", \"mathematics.py\", \"ctf.py\", \"science.py\"],\n   model=[\"openai/gpt-4o\", \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"],\n   max_tasks=8,\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\"      \n)\n\n\nDynamic Tasks\nIn the above examples tasks are ready from the filesystem. It is also possible to dynamically create a set of tasks and pass them to the eval_set() function. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval_set\n\n@task\ndef create_task(dataset: str):\n  return Task(dataset=csv_dataset(dataset))\n\nmmlu = create_task(\"mmlu.csv\")\nmaths = create_task(\"maths.csv\")\n\neval_set(\n   [mmlu, maths],\n   model=[\"openai/gpt-4o\", \"anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\"      \n)\nNotice that we create our tasks from a function decorated with @task. Doing this is a critical requirement because it enables Inspect to capture the arguments to create_task() and use that to distinguish the two tasks (in turn used to pair tasks to log files for retries).\nThere are two fundamental requirements for dynamic tasks used with eval_set():\n\nThey are created using an @task function as described above.\nTheir parameters use ordinary Python types (like str, int, list, etc.) as opposed to custom objects (which are hard to serialise consistently).\n\nNote that you can pass a solver to an @task function, so long as it was created by a function decorated with @solver.\n\n\nRetry Options\nThere are a number of options that control the retry behaviour of eval sets:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--retry-attempts\nMaximum number of retry attempts (defaults to 10)\n\n\n--retry-wait\nTime to wait between attempts, increased exponentially. (defaults to 30, resulting in waits of 30, 60, 120, 240, etc.)\n\n\n--retry-connections\nReduce max connections at this rate with each retry (defaults to 0.5)\n\n\n--no-retry-cleanup\nDo not cleanup failed log files after retries.\n\n\n\nFor example, here we specify a base wait time of 120 seconds:\ninspect eval-set mmlu.py mathematics.py \\\n   --log-dir logs-run-42\n   --retry-wait 120\nOr with the eval_set() function:\neval_set(\n   [\"mmlu.py\", \"mathematics.py\"],\n   log_dir=\"logs-run-42\",\n   retry_wait=120\n)\n\n\nPublishing\nYou can bundle a standalone version of the log viewer for an eval set using the bundling options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n--bundle-dir\nDirectory to write standalone log viewer files to.\n\n\n--bundle-overwrite\nOverwrite existing bundle directory (defaults to not overwriting).\n\n\n\nThe bundle directory can then be deployed to any static web server (GitHub Pages, S3 buckets, or Netlify, for example) to provide a standalone version of the log viewer for the eval set.

    "section": "Logging Context",
    "text": "Logging Context\nWe mentioned above that you need to specify a dedicated log directory for each eval set that you run. This requirement exists for a couple of reasons:\n\nThe log directory provides a durable record of which tasks are completed so that you can run the eval set as many times as is required to finish all of the work. For example, you might get halfway through a run and then encounter provider rate limit errors. You’ll want to be able to restart the eval set later (potentially even many hours later) and the dedicated log directory enables you to do this.\nThis enables you to enumerate and analyse all of the eval logs in the suite as a cohesive whole (rather than having them intermixed with the results of other runs).\n\nOnce all of the tasks in an eval set are complete, re-running inspect eval-set or eval_set() on the same log directory will be a no-op as there is no more work to do. At this point you can use the list_eval_logs() function to collect up logs for analysis:\nresults = list_eval_logs(\"logs-run-42\")\nIf you are calling the eval_set() function it will return a tuple of bool and list[EvalLog], where the bool indicates whether all tasks were completed:\nsuccess, logs = eval_set(...)\nif success:\n    # analyse logs\nelse:\n    # will need to run eval_set again\nNote that eval_set() does by default do quite a bit of retrying (up to 10 times by default) so success=False reflects the case where even after all of the retries the tasks were still not completed (this might occur due to a service outage or perhaps bugs in eval code raising runtime errors).\n\nSample Preservation\nWhen retrying a log file, Inspect will attempt to re-use completed samples from the original task. This can result in substantial time and cost savings compared to starting over from the beginning.\n\nIDs and Shuffling\nAn important constraint on the ability to re-use completed samples is matching them up correctly with samples in the new task. To do this, Inspect requires stable unique identifiers for each sample. This can be achieved in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nSamples can have an explicit id field which contains the unique identifier; or\nYou can rely on Inspect’s assignment of an auto-incrementing id for samples, however this will not work correctly if your dataset is shuffled. Inspect will log a warning and not re-use samples if it detects that the dataset.shuffle() method was called, however if you are shuffling by some other means this automatic safeguard won’t be applied.\n\nIf dataset shuffling is important to your evaluation and you want to preserve samples for retried tasks, then you should include an explicit id field in your dataset.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task. Larger numbers of concurrent samples will result in higher throughput, but will also result in completed samples being written less frequently to the log file, and consequently less total recovable samples in the case of an interrupted task.\nBy default, Inspect sets the value of max_samples to max_connections + 1 (note that it would rarely make sense to set it lower than max_connections). The default max_connections is 10, which will typically result in samples being written to the log frequently. On the other hand, setting a very large max_connections (e.g. 100 max_connections for a dataset with 100 samples) may result in very few recoverable samples in the case of an interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your task involves tool calls and/or sandboxes, then you will likely want to set max_samples to greater than max_connections, as your samples will sometimes be calling the model (using up concurrent connections) and sometimes be executing code in the sandbox (using up concurrent subprocess calls). While running tasks you can see the utilization of connections and subprocesses in realtime and tune your max_samples accordingly.",

    "text": "Task Enumeration\nWhen running eval sets tasks can be specified either individually (as in the examples above) or can be enumerated from the filesystem. You can organise tasks in many different ways, below we cover some of the more common options.\n\nMultiple Tasks in a File\nThe simplest possible organisation would be multiple tasks defined in a single source file. Consider this source file (ctf.py) with two tasks in it:\n@task\ndef jeopardy():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\n\n@task\ndef attack_defense():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\nWe can run both of these tasks with the following command (note for this and the remainder of examples we’ll assume that you have let an INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL environment variable so you don’t need to pass the --model argument explicitly):\n$ inspect eval-set ctf.py --log-dir logs-run-42\nOr equivalently:\neval_set(\"ctf.py\", log_dir=\"logs-run-42\")\nNote that during development and debugging we can also run the tasks individually:\n$ inspect eval ctf.py@jeopardy\n\n\nMultiple Tasks in a Directory\nNext, let’s consider a multiple tasks in a directory. Imagine you have the following directory structure, where jeopardy.py and attack_defense.py each have one or more @task functions defined:\nsecurity/\n  import.py\n  analyze.py\n  jeopardy.py\n  attack_defense.py\nHere is the listing of all the tasks in the suite:\n$ inspect list tasks security\njeopardy.py@crypto\njeopardy.py@decompile\njeopardy.py@packet\njeopardy.py@heap_trouble\nattack_defense.py@saar\nattack_defense.py@bank\nattack_defense.py@voting\nattack_defense.py@dns\nYou can run this eval set as follows:\n$ inspect eval-set security --log-dir logs-security-02-09-24\nNote that some of the files in this directory don’t contain evals (e.g. import.py and analyze.py). These files are not read or executed by inspect eval-set (which only executes files that contain @task definitions).\nIf we wanted to run more than one directory we could do so by just passing multiple directory names. For example:\n$ inspect eval-set security persuasion --log-dir logs-suite-42\nOr equivalently:\neval_set([\"security\", \"persuasion\"], log_dir=\"logs-suite-42\")",

    "text": "Listing and Filtering\n\nRecursive Listings\nNote that directories or expanded globs of directory names passed to eval-set are recursively scanned for tasks. So you could have a very deep hierarchy of directories, with a mix of task and non task scripts, and the eval-set command or function will discover all of the tasks automatically.\nThere are some rules for how recursive directory scanning works that you should keep in mind:\n\nSources files and directories that start with . or _ are not scanned for tasks.\nDirectories named env, venv, and tests are not scanned for tasks.\n\n\n\nAttributes and Filters\nEval suites will sometimes be defined purely by directory structure, but there will be cross-cutting concerns that are also used to filter what is run. For example, you might want to define some tasks as part of a “light” suite that is less expensive and time consuming to run. This is supported by adding attributes to task decorators. For example:\n@task(light=True)\ndef jeopardy():\n  return Task(\n    ...\n  )\nGiven this, you could list all of the light tasks in security and pass them to eval() as follows:\nlight_suite = list_tasks(\n  \"security\", \n  filter = lambda task: task.attribs.get(\"light\") is True\n)\nlogs = eval_set(light_suite, log_dir=\"logs-light-42\")\nNote that the inspect list tasks command can also be used to enumerate tasks in plain text or JSON (use one or more -F options if you want to filter tasks):\n$ inspect list tasks security\n$ inspect list tasks security --json\n$ inspect list tasks security --json -F light=true\nYou can feed the results of inspect list tasks into inspect eval-set using xargs as follows:\n$ inspect list tasks security | xargs \\\n   inspect eval-set --log-dir logs-security-42\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne important thing to keep in mind when using attributes to filter tasks is that both inspect list tasks (and the underlying list_tasks() function) do not execute code when scanning for tasks (rather they parse it). This means that if you want to use a task attribute in a filtering expression it needs to be a constant (rather than the result of function call). For example:\n# this is valid for filtering expressions\n@task(light=True)\ndef jeopardy():\n  ...\n\n# this is NOT valid for filtering expressions\n@task(light=light_enabled(\"ctf\"))\ndef jeopardy():\n  ...",

    "text": "Model Connections\n\nMax Connections\nConnections to model APIs are the most fundamental unit of concurrency to manage. The main thing that limits model API concurrency is not local compute or network availability, but rather rate limits imposed by model API providers. Here we run an evaluation and set the maximum connections to 20:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-connections 20\nThe default value for max connections is 10. By increasing it we might get better performance due to higher parallelism, however we might get worse performance if this causes us to frequently hit rate limits (which are retried with exponential backoff). The “correct” max connections for your evaluations will vary based on your actual rate limit and the size and complexity of your evaluations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that max connections is applied per-model. This means that if you use a grader model from a provider distinct from the one you are evaluating you will get extra concurrency (as each model will enforce its own max connections).\n\n\n\n\n\nRate Limits\nWhen you run an eval you’ll see information reported on the current active connection usage as well as the number of HTTP retries that have occurred (Inspect will automatically retry on rate limits and other errors likely to be transient):\n\nHere we’ve set a higher max connections than the default (30). While you might be tempted to set this very high to see how much concurrent traffic you can sustain, more often than not setting too high a max connections will result in slower evaluations, because retries are done using exponential backoff, and bouncing off of rate limits too frequently will have you waiting minutes for retries to fire.\nYou should experiment with various values for max connections at different times of day (evening is often very different than daytime!). Generally speaking, you want to see some number of HTTP rate limits enforced so you know that you are somewhere close to ideal utilisation, but if you see hundreds of these you are likely over-saturating and experiencing a net slowdown.\n\n\nLimiting Retries\nBy default, Inspect will retry model API calls indefinitely (with exponential backoff) when a recoverable HTTP error occurs. The initial backoff is 3 seconds and exponentiation will result in a 25 minute wait for the 10th request (then 30 minutes for the 11th and subsequent requests). You can limit Inspect’s retries using the --max-retries option:\ninspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-retries 10\nNote that model interfaces themselves may have internal retry behavior (for example, the openai and anthropic packages both retry twice by default).\nYou can put a limit on the total time for retries using the --timeout option:\ninspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --timeout 600 \n\n\nDebugging Retries\nIf you want more insight into Model API connections and retries, specify log_level=http. For example:\ninspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --log-level=http\nYou can also view all of the HTTP requests for the current (or most recent) evaluation run using the inspect trace http command. For example:\ninspect trace http           # show all http requests\ninspect trace http --failed  # show only failed requests",

This is because most tasks consist of 10 or more samples, which generally means that sample parallelism is enough to make full use of the max_connections defined for the active model.\nIf however, the number of samples per task is substantially lower than max_connections then you might benefit from running multiple tasks in parallel. You can do this via the --max-tasks CLI option or max_tasks parameter to the eval() function. For example, here we run all of the tasks in the current working directory with up to 5 tasks run in parallel:\n$ inspect eval . --max-tasks=5 \nAnother common scenario is running the same task with variations of hyperparameters (e.g. prompts, generation config, etc.).

Individual sandbox providers can establish their own default limits (for example, the Docker provider has a default of 2 * os.cpu_count()). You can modify this option as required, but be aware that container runtimes have resource limits, and pushing up against and beyond them can lead to instability and failed evaluations.\nWhen a max_sandboxes is applied, an indicator at the bottom of the task status screen will be shown:\n\nNote that when max_sandboxes is applied this effectively creates a global max_samples limit that is equal to the max_sandboxes.\n\n\nMax Subprocesses\nThe max_subprocesses option determines how many subprocess calls can run in parallel.

Depending on the nature of execution done inside sandbox environments, you might benefit from increasing or decreasing max_subprocesses.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task.

    "text": "Solvers and Scorers\n\nREST APIs\nIt’s possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will call other REST APIs. Two things to keep in mind when doing this are:\n\nIt’s critical that connections to other APIs use async HTTP APIs (i.e. the httpx module rather than the requests module). This is because Inspect’s parallelism relies on everything being async, so if you make a blocking HTTP call with requests it will actually hold up all of the rest of the work in the system!\nAs with model APIs, rate limits may be in play, so it’s important not to over-saturate these connections. Recall that Inspect runs all samples in parallel so if you have 500 samples and don’t do anything to limit concurrency, you will likely end up making hundreds of calls at a time to the API.\n\nHere’s some (oversimplified) example code that illustrates how to call a REST API within an Inspect component. We use the async interface of the httpx module, and we use Inspect’s concurrency() function to limit simultaneous connections to 10:\nimport httpx\nfrom inspect_ai.util import concurrency\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import Generate, TaskState\n\nclient = httpx.AsyncClient()\n\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n  ...\n  # wrap the call to client.get() in an async concurrency \n  # block to limit simultaneous connections to 10\n  async with concurrency(\"my-rest-api\", 10):\n    response = await client.get(\"https://example.com/api\")\nNote that we pass a name (“my-rest-api”) to the concurrency() function. This provides a named scope for managing concurrency for calls to that specific API/service.\n\n\nParallel Code\nGenerally speaking, you should try to make all of the code you write within Inspect solvers, tools, and scorers as parallel as possible. The main idea is to eagerly post as much work as you can, and then allow the various concurrency gates described above to take care of not overloading remote APIs or local resources. There are two keys to writing parallel code:\n\nUse async for all potentially expensive operations. If you are calling a remote API, use the httpx.AsyncClient. If you are running local code, use the subprocess() function described above.\nIf your async work can be parallelised, do it using asyncio.gather(). For example, if you are calling three different model APIs to score a task, you can call them all in parallel. Or if you need to retrieve 10 web pages you don’t need to do it in a loop—rather, you can fetch them all at once.\n\n\nModel Requests\nLet’s say you have a scorer that uses three different models to score based on majority vote. You could make all of the model API calls in parallel as follows:\nfrom inspect_ai.model import get_model\n\nmodels = [\n  get_model(\"openai/gpt-4\"),\n  get_model(\"anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229\"),\n  get_model(\"mistral/mistral-large-latest\")\n]\n\noutput = \"Output to be scored\"\nprompt = f\"Could you please score the following output?\\n\\n{output}\"\n\ngraders = [model.generate(prompt) for model in models]\n\ngrader_outputs = await asyncio.gather(*graders)\nNote that we don’t await the call to model.generate() when building our list of graders. Rather the call to asyncio.gather() will await each of these requests and return when they have all completed. Inspect’s internal handling of max_connections for model APIs will throttle these requests, so there is no need to worry about how many you put in flight.\n\n\nWeb Requests\nHere’s an example of using asyncio.gather() to parallelise web requests:\nimport asyncio\nimport httpx\nclient = httpx.AsyncClient()\n\npages = [\n  \"https://www.openai.com\",\n  \"https://www.anthropic.com\",\n  \"https://www.google.com\",\n  \"https://mistral.ai/\"\n]\n\ndownloads = [client.get(page) for page in pages]\n\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)\nNote that we don’t await the client requests when building up our list of downloads. Rather, we let asyncio.gather() await all of them, returning only when all of the results are available. Compared to looping over each page download this will execute much, much quicker. Note that if you are sending requests to a REST API that might have rate limits, you should consider wrapping your HTTP requests in a concurrency() block. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import concurrency\n\nasync def download(page):\n  async with concurrency(\"my-web-api\", 2):\n    return await client.get(page)\n  \ndownloads = [download(page) for page in pages]\n\nresults = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)\n\n\n\nSubprocesses\nIt’s possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will need to launch child processes to perform various tasks. Subprocesses have similar considerations as calling APIs: you want to make sure that they don’t block the rest of the work in Inspect (so they should be invoked with async) and you also want to make sure they don’t provide too much concurrency (i.e. you wouldn’t want to launch 200 processes at once on a 4 core machine!)\nTo assist with this, Inspect provides the subprocess() function. This async function takes a command and arguments and invokes the specified command asynchronously, collecting and returning stdout and stderr. The subprocess() function also automatically limits concurrent child processes to the number of CPUs on your system (os.cpu_count()). Here’s an example from the implementation of a list_files() tool:\n@tool\ndef list_files():\n    async def execute(dir: str):\n        \"\"\"List the files in a directory.\n\n        Args:\n            dir: Directory\n\n        Returns:\n            File listing of the directory\n        \"\"\"\n        result = await subprocess([\"ls\", dir])\n        if result.success:\n            return result.stdout\n        else:\n            raise ToolError(result.stderr)\n\n    return execute\nThe maximum number of concurrent subprocesses can be modified using the --max-subprocesses option. For example:\n$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-subprocesses 4\nNote that if you need to execute computationally expensive code in an eval, you should always factor it into a call to subprocess() so that you get optimal concurrency and performance.\n\nTimeouts\nIf you need to ensure that your subprocess runs for no longer than a specified interval, you can use the timeout option. For example:\ntry:\n  result = await subprocess([\"ls\", dir], timeout = 30)\nexcept TimeoutError:\n  ...\nIf a timeout occurs, then a TimeoutError will be thrown (which your code should generally handle in whatever manner is appropriate).",

By default, Inspect uses asyncio and is compatible with user code that uses native asyncio functions.\n\nUsing Trio\nTo configure Inspect to use Trio, set the INSPECT_ASYNC_BACKEND environment variable:\nexport INSPECT_ASYNC_BACKEND=trio\ninspect eval math.py\nNote that there are some features of Inspect that do not yet work when using Trio, including:\n\nFull screen task display uses the textual framework, which currently works only with asyncio. Inspect will automatically switch to “rich” task display (which is less interactive) when using Trio.\nInteraction with AWS S3 (e.g. for log storage) uses the s3fs package, which currently works only with asyncio.\nThe Bedrock provider depends on asyncio so cannot be used with the Trio backend.\n\n\n\nPortable Async\nIf you are writing async code in your Inspect solvers, tools, scorers, or extensions, you should whenever possible use the AnyIO library rather than asyncio. If you do this, your Inspect code will work correctly no matter what async backend is in use.\nAnyIO implements Trio-like structured concurrency (SC) on top of asyncio and works in harmony with the native SC of Trio itself.\nTo learn more about AnyIO see the following resources:\n\nhttps://anyio.readthedocs.io/\nhttps://lewoudar.medium.com/anyio-all-you-need-for-async-programming-stuff-4cd084d0f6bd",

You can override the default behavior using the streaming model argument.

    "text": "Usage\nUsing the human_cli agent is as straightforward as specifying it as the --solver for any existing task. Repeating the example above:\ninspect eval inspect_evals/gdm_intercode_ctf \\\n    --sample-id 44 --solver human_cli\nOr alternatively from within Python:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import human_cli\nfrom inspect_evals import gdm_intercode_ctf\n\neval(gdm_intercode_ctf(), sample_id=44, solver=human_cli())\nThere are however some requirements that should be met by your task before using it with the human CLI agent:\n\nIt should be solvable by using the tools available in a Linux environment (plus potentially access to the web, which the baseliner can do using an external web browser).\nThe dataset input must fully specify the instructions for the task. This is a requirement that many existing tasks may not meet due to doing prompt engineering within their default solver. For example, the Intercode CTF eval had to be modified in this fashion to make it compatible with human agent.\n\n\nContainer Access\nThe human agent works on the task within the default sandbox container for the task. Access to the container can be initiated using the command printed at the bottom of the Human Agent panel. For example:\ndocker exec -it inspect-gdm_intercod-itmzq4e-default-1 bash -l\nAlternatively, if the human agent is working within VS Code then two links are provided to access the container within VS Code:\n\nVS Code Window opens a new VS Code window logged in to the container. The human agent can than create terminals, browse the file system, etc. using the VS Code interface.\nVS Code Terminal opens a new terminal in the main editor area of VS Code (so that it is afforded more space than the default terminal in the panel.\n\n\n\nTask Commands\nThe Human agent installs agent task tools in the default sandbox and presents the user with both task instructions and documentation for the various tools (e.g. task submit, task start, task stop, task instructions, etc.). By default, the following command are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntask submit\nSubmit your final answer for the task.\n\n\ntask quit\nQuit the task without submitting an answer.\n\n\ntask note\nRecord a note in the task transcript.\n\n\ntask status\nPrint task status (clock, scoring , etc.)\n\n\ntask start\nStart the task clock (resume working)\n\n\ntask stop\nStop the task clock (pause working).\n\n\ntask instructions\nDisplay task command and instructions.\n\n\n\nNote that the instructions are also copied to an instructions.txt file in the container user’s working directory.\n\n\nAnswer Submission\nWhen the human agent has completed the task, they submit their answer using the task submitcommand. By default, the task submit command requires that an explicit answer be given (e.g. task submit picoCTF{73bfc85c1ba7}).\nHowever, if your task is scored by reading from the container filesystem then no explicit answer need be provided. Indicate this by passing answer=False to the human_cli():\nsolver=human_cli(answer=False)\nOr from the CLI, use the -S option:\n--solver human_cli -S answer=false\nYou can also specify a regex to match the answer against for validation, for example:\nsolver=human_cli(answer=r\"picoCTF{\\w+}\")\n\n\nQuitting\nIf the user is unable to complete the task in some allotted time they may quit the task using the task quit command. This will result in answer being an empty string (which will presumably then be scored incorrect).\n\n\nIntermediate Scoring\nYou can optionally make intermediate scoring available to human baseliners so that they can check potential answers as they work. Use the intermediate_scoring option (which defaults to False) to do this:\nsolver=human_cli(intermediate_scoring=True)\nOr from the CLI, use the -S option:\n--solver human_cli -S intermediate_scoring=true\nWith this option enabled, the human agent can check their potential score on the task for a given answer using the task score command. For example:\ntask score picoCTF{73bfc85c1ba7}\n\n\nContainer User\nBy default, the human agent will login to the container using its default user. You can specify an alternate user via the user option. For example:\nsolver=human_cli(user=\"myuser\")\nOr from the CLI, use the -S option:\n--solver human_cli -S user=myuser",

    "text": "Sandbox Bridge\nThe sandbox_agent_bridge() can bridge agents written against the OpenAI Completions, OpenAI Responses, or Anthropic API. To bridge an agent running in a sandbox to Inspect:\n\nConfigure your sandbox (e.g. via its Dockerfile) to contain the agent that you want to run. The agent should be configured to talk to the OpenAI API on localhost port 3131 (e.g. OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:13131/v1 or ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:13131).\nWrite a standard Inspect agent that uses the sandbox_agent_bridge() context manager and the sandbox().exec() method to invoke the custom agent.\n\nThe sandbox bridge works via running a proxy server inside the sandbox container which receives requests for the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. This proxy server in turn relays requests to the current Inspect model provider.\nFor example, here we build an agent that runs a custom agent binary (passing it input on the command line and reading output from stdout):\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import (\n    Agent, AgentState, agent, sandbox_agent_bridge\n)\nfrom inspect_ai.model import user_prompt\nfrom inspect_ai.util import sandbox\n\n@agent\ndef my_agent() -&gt; AgentState:\n    async def execute(state: AgentState) -&gt; AgentState:\n1        async with sandbox_agent_bridge(state) as bridge:\n            \n2            prompt = user_prompt(state.messages)\n            \n3            result = sandbox().exec(\n                cmd=[\n                    \"/opt/my_agent\",\n                    \"--prompt\",\n                    prompt.text\n                ],\n4                env={\"OPENAI_BASE_URL\": f\"http://localhost:{bridge.port}/v1\"}\n            )\n            if not result.success:\n                raise RuntimeError(f\"Agent error: {result.stderr}\")\n\n5            return bridge.state\n\n    return execute\n\n1\n\nUse the sandbox_agent_bridge() context manager to redirect the OpenAI API to the Inspect model provider. Pass the state so that the bridge can automatically keep track of changes to messages and output based on model calls passing through the bridge.\n\n2\n\nExtract the last user message from the message history with user_prompt().\n\n3\n\nRun the agent, using a CLI argument for input and stdout for output (other agents may use more sophisticated encoding schemes for messages in and out).\n\n4\n\nRedirect the OpenAI API to talk to a proxy server that communicates back to the current Inspect model provider. Note that we read the port to listen on from the bridge yielded by the context manager.\n\n5\n\nReturn the state changes automatically tracked by the bridge.\n\n\nThe Claude Code and Codex CLI examples provide more in-depth demonstrations of running custom agents in sandboxes.",

For example:\nmodel = get_model(\"openai/gpt-4o\")\n\nmodel = get_model(\n    \"openai/gpt-4o\",\n    config=GenerateConfig(temperature=0.9)\n)\nYou can also pass provider specific parameters as additional arguments to get_model(). For example:\nmodel = get_model(\"hf/openai-community/gpt2\", device=\"cuda:0\")\n\nModel Caching\nBy default, calls to get_model() are memoized, meaning that calls with identical parameters resolve to a cached version of the model. You can disable this by passing memoize=False:\nmodel = get_model(\"openai/gpt-4o\", memoize=False)\nFinally, if you prefer to create and fully close model clients at their place of use, you can use the async context manager built in to the Model class. For example:\nasync with get_model(\"openai/gpt-4o\") as model:\n    eval(mytask(), model=model)\nIf you are not in an async context there is also a sync context manager available:\nwith get_model(\"hf/Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B\") as model:\n    eval(mytask(), model=model)\nNote though that this won’t work with model providers that require an async close operation (OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Together, Groq, Ollama, llama-cpp-python, and CloudFlare).",

    "title": "Using Models",
    "section": "Model Roles",
    "text": "Model Roles\nModel roles enable you to create aliases for the various models used in your tasks, and then dynamically vary those roles when running an evaluation. For example, you might have a “critic” or “monitor” role, or perhaps “red_team” and “blue_team” roles. Roles are included in the log and displayed in model events within the transcript.\nHere is a scorer that utilises a “grader” role when binding to a model:\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_grader() -&gt; Scorer:\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        model = get_model(role=\"grader\")\n        ...\nBy default if there is no “grader” role specified, the default model for the evaluation will be returned. Model roles can be specified when using inspect eval or calling the eval() function:\ninspect eval math.py --model-role grader=google/gemini-2.0-flash\nOr with eval():\neval(\"math.py\", model_roles = { \"grader\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash\" })\nNote that the built-in model-graded scorers (e.g. model_graded_qa(), model_graded_fact()) look for the grader role by default.\n\nRole Resolution\nModel roles are resolved based on what is passed to eval(). This means that if you fully construct tasks before calling eval() (e.g. by calling their @task function) then the initialization code for tasks, solvers, and scorers for can’t see the model role definitions.\nGiven this, you should always call get_model() inside the implementation of your solver or scorer function rather than during initialization. For example:\nDon’t do this (model role not yet visible)\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_grader() -&gt; Scorer:\n1    model = get_model(role=\"grader\")\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):   \n        ...\n\n1\n\nRole is not yet visible when @task function is called before eval().\n\n\nRather do this (defer until role is visible)\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_grader() -&gt; Scorer:\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):  \n1        model = get_model(role=\"grader\")\n        ...\n\n1\n\nRole is visible since we are calling this after eval().\n\n\n\n\nRole Defaults\nBy default if there is a no role explicitly defined then get_model(role=\"...\") will return the default model for the evaluation. You can specify an alternate default model as follows:\nmodel = get_model(role=\"grader\", default=\"openai/gpt-4o\")\nThis means that you can use model roles as a means of external configurability even if you aren’t yet explicitly taking advantage of them.\n\n\nRoles for Tasks\nIn some cases it may not be convenient to specify model_roles in the top level call to eval(). For example, you might be running an Eval Set to explore the behaviour of different models for a given role. In this case, do not specify model_roles at the eval level, rather, specify them at the task level.\nFor example, imagine we have a task named blues_clues that we want to vary the red and blue teams for in an eval set:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval_set, task_with\nfrom ctf_tasks import blues_clues \n\ntasks = [\n    task_with(blues_clues(), model_roles = {\n        \"red_team\": \"openai/gpt-4o\",\n        \"blue_team\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash\"\n    }),()\n    task_with(blues_clues, model_roles = {\n        \"red_team\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash\",\n        \"blue_team\": \"openai/gpt-4o\"\n    })\n]\n\neval_set(tasks, log_dir=\"...\")\nNote that we also don’t specify a model for this eval (it doesn’t have a main model but rather just the red and blue team roles).\nAs illustrated above, you can define as many named roles as you need. When using eval() or Task roles are specified using a dictionary. When using inspect eval you can include multiple --model-role options on the command line:\ninspect eval math.py \\\n   --model-role red_team=google/gemini-2.0-flash \\\n   --model-role blue_team=openai/gpt-4o-mini",

    "text": "Scores and Answers\nReliable, high quality scoring is a critical component of every evaluation, and developing custom scorers that deliver this can be challenging. One major difficulty lies in the free form text nature of model output: we have a very specific target we are comparing against and we sometimes need to pick the answer out of a sea of text. Model graded output introduces another set of challenges entirely.\nFor comparison based scoring, scorers typically perform two core tasks:\n\nExtract the answer from the model’s output; and\nCompare the extracted answer to the target.\n\nA scorer can fail to correctly score output at either of these steps. Failing to extract an answer entirely can occur (e.g. due to a regex that’s not quite flexible enough) and as can failing to correctly identify equivalent answers (e.g. thinking that “1,242” is different from “1242.00” or that “Yes.” is different than “yes”).\nYou can use the log viewer to catch and evaluate these sorts of issues. For example, here we can see that we were unable to extract answers for a couple of questions that were scored incorrect:\n\nIt’s possible that these answers are legitimately incorrect. However it’s also possible that the correct answer is in the model’s output but just in a format we didn’t quite expect. In each case you’ll need to drill into the sample to investigate.\nAnswers don’t just appear magically, scorers need to produce them during scoring. The scorers built in to Inspect all do this, but when you create a custom scorer, you should be sure to always include an answer in the Score objects you return if you can. For example:\nreturn Score(\n    value=\"C\" if extracted == target.text else \"I\", \n    answer=extracted, \n    explanation=state.output.completion\n)\nIf we only return the value of “C” or “I” we’d lose the context of exactly what was being compared when the score was assigned.\nNote there is also an explanation field: this is also important, as it allows you to view the entire context from which the answer was extracted from.",

However you can also order by score, or order by samples (so you see all of the results for a given sample across all epochs presented together).

Inspect installs a log handler that displays logging output above eval progress as well as saves it into the evaluation log file.\nIf you use the recommend practice of the Python logging library for obtaining a logger your logs will interoperate well with Inspect. For example, here we developing a web search tool and want to log each time a query occurs:\n# setup logger for this source file\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n# log each time we see a web query\nlogger.info(f\"web query: {query}\")\nAll of these log entries will be included in the sample transcript.\n\nLog Levels\nThe log levels and their applicability are described below (in increasing order of severity):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndebug\nDetailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.\n\n\ntrace\nShow trace messages for runtime actions (e.g. model calls, subprocess exec, etc.).\n\n\nhttp\nHTTP diagnostics including requests and response statuses\n\n\ninfo\nConfirmation that things are working as expected.\n\n\nwarning\nor indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’).

This enables you to include many calls to logger.info() in your code without having them show by default, while also making them available in the log viewer should you need them.\nIf you’d like to see ‘info’ messages in the console as well, use the --log-level info option:\n$ inspect eval biology_qa.py --log-level info\n\nYou can use the --log-level-transcript option to control what level is written to the sample transcript:\n$ inspect eval biology_qa.py --log-level-transcript http\nNote that you can also set the log levels using the INSPECT_LOG_LEVEL and INSPECT_LOG_LEVEL_TRANSCRIPT environment variables (which are often included in a .env configuration file.\n\n\n\nExternal File\nIn addition to seeing the Python logging activity at the end of an eval run in the log viewer, you can also arrange to have Python logger entries written to an external file. Set the INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE environment variable to do this:\nexport INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE=/tmp/inspect.log\nYou can set this in the shell or within your global .env file. By default, messages of level info and higher will be written to the log file. If you set your main --log-level lower than that (e.g. to http) then the log file will follow. To set a distinct log level for the file, set the INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_FILE environment variable. For example:\nexport INSPECT_PY_LOGGER_LEVEL=http\nUse tail --follow to track the contents of the log file in realtime. For example:\ntail --follow /tmp/inspect.log",

Note that the automatically generated compose file will restrict internet access by default, so if your evaluations require this you’ll need to provide your own compose.yaml file.\nHere’s an example of a compose.yaml file that sets container resource limits and isolates it from all network interactions including internet access:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    build: .\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 0.5gb\n    network_mode: none\n\nThe init: true entry enables the container to respond to shutdown requests. The command is provided to prevent the container from exiting after it starts.\nHere is what a simple compose.yaml would look like for a local pre-built image named ctf-agent-environment (resource and network limits excluded for brevity):\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nThe ctf-agent-environment is not an image that exists on a remote registry, so we add the x-local: true to indicate that it should not be pulled. If local images are tagged, they also will not be pulled by default (so x-local: true is not required). For example:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment:1.0.0\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nIf we are using an image from a remote registry we similarly don’t need to include x-local:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: python:3.12-bookworm\n    init: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n\nSee the Docker Compose documentation for information on all available container options.\n\n\nMultiple Environments\nIn some cases you may want to create multiple sandbox environments (e.g. if one environment has complex dependencies that conflict with the dependencies of other environments). To do this specify multiple named services:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 0.5gb\n  victim:\n    image: ctf-victim-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 1gb\n\nThe first environment listed is the “default” environment, and can be accessed from within a tool with a normal call to sandbox(). Other environments would be accessed by name, for example:\nsandbox()          # default sandbox environment\nsandbox(\"victim\")  # named sandbox environment\nIf you define multiple sandbox environments the default sandbox environment will be determined as follows:\n\nFirst, take any sandbox environment named default;\nThen, take any environment with the x-default key set to true;\nFinally, use the first sandbox environment as the default.\n\nYou can use the sandbox_default() context manager to temporarily change the default sandbox (for example, if you have tools that always target the default sandbox that you want to temporarily redirect):\nwith sandbox_default(\"victim\"):\n    # call tools, etc.\n\n\nInfrastructure\nNote that in many cases you’ll want to provision additional infrastructure (e.g. other hosts or volumes). For example, here we define an additional container (“writer”) as well as a volume shared between the default container and the writer container:\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    volumes:\n      - ctf-challenge-volume:/shared-data\n    \n  writer:\n    image: ctf-challenge-writer\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    volumes:\n      - ctf-challenge-volume:/shared-data\nvolumes:\n  ctf-challenge-volume:\nSee the documentation on Docker Compose files for information on their full schema and feature set.\n\n\nSample Metadata\nYou might want to interpolate Sample metadata into your Docker compose files. You can do this using the standard compose environment variable syntax, where any metadata in the Sample is made available with a SAMPLE_METADATA_ prefix. For example, you might have a per-sample memory limit (with a default value of 0.5gb if unspecified):\nservices:\n  default:\n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    init: true\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: ${SAMPLE_METADATA_MEMORY_LIMIT-0.5gb}\nNote that - suffix that provides the default value of 0.5gb. This is important to include so that when the compose file is read without the context of a Sample (for example, when pulling/building images at startup) that a default value is available.",

For example, here we cleanup all environments associated with the docker provider:\n$ inspect sandbox cleanup docker\nIn some cases you may prefer not to cleanup environments. For example, you might want to examine their state interactively from the shell in order to debug an agent.

    "section": "Resource Management",
    "text": "Resource Management\nCreating and executing code within Docker containers can be expensive both in terms of memory and CPU utilisation. Inspect provides some automatic resource management to keep usage reasonable in the default case. This section describes that behaviour as well as how you can tune it for your use-cases.\n\nMax Sandboxes\nThe max_sandboxes option determines how many sandboxes can be executed in parallel. Individual sandbox providers can establish their own default limits (for example, the Docker provider has a default of 2 * os.cpu_count()). You can modify this option as required, but be aware that container runtimes have resource limits, and pushing up against and beyond them can lead to instability and failed evaluations.\nWhen a max_sandboxes is applied, an indicator at the bottom of the task status screen will be shown:\n\nNote that when max_sandboxes is applied this effectively creates a global max_samples limit that is equal to the max_sandboxes.\n\n\nMax Subprocesses\nThe max_subprocesses option determines how many subprocess calls can run in parallel. By default, this is set to os.cpu_count(). Depending on the nature of execution done inside sandbox environments, you might benefit from increasing or decreasing max_subprocesses.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task. Larger numbers of concurrent samples will result in higher throughput, but will also result in completed samples being written less frequently to the log file, and consequently less total recovable samples in the case of an interrupted task.\nBy default, Inspect sets the value of max_samples to max_connections + 1 (note that it would rarely make sense to set it lower than max_connections). The default max_connections is 10, which will typically result in samples being written to the log frequently. On the other hand, setting a very large max_connections (e.g. 100 max_connections for a dataset with 100 samples) may result in very few recoverable samples in the case of an interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your task involves tool calls and/or sandboxes, then you will likely want to set max_samples to greater than max_connections, as your samples will sometimes be calling the model (using up concurrent connections) and sometimes be executing code in the sandbox (using up concurrent subprocess calls). While running tasks you can see the utilization of connections and subprocesses in realtime and tune your max_samples accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\nContainer Resources\nUse a compose.yaml file to limit the resources consumed by each running container. For example:\n\n\ncompose.yaml\n\nservices:\n  default: \n    image: ctf-agent-environment\n    x-local: true\n    command: tail -f /dev/null\n    cpus: 1.0\n    mem_limit: 0.5gb",

However, approving every tool call can be quite tedious, and not all tool calls are necessarily worthy of human oversight.\nYou can chain to together the human and auto approvers in an approval policy to only approve selected tool calls. For example, here we create a policy that asks for human approval of only interactive web browser tool calls:\napprovers:\n  - name: human\n    tools: [\"web_browser_click\", \"web_browser_type\"]\n\n  - name: auto\n    tools: \"*\"\nNavigational web browser tool calls (e.g. web_browser_go) are approved automatically via the catch-all auto approver at the end of the chain. Note that when listing an approver in a policy you indicate which tools it should handle using a glob or list of globs. These globs are prefix matched so the web_browser_type glob matches both web_browser_type and web_browser_type_submit.\nTo use this policy, pass the path to the policy YAML file as the approver. For example:\ninspect eval browser.py --approval approval.yaml\nYou can also match on tool arguments (for tools that dispatch many action types). For example, here is an approval policy for the Computer Tool which allows typing and mouse movement but requires approval for key combos (e.g. Enter or a shortcut) and typing:\n\n\napproval.yaml\n\napprovers:\n  - name: human\n    tools:\n      - computer(action='key'\n      - computer(action='left_click'\n      - computer(action='middle_click'\n      - computer(action='double_click'\n\n  - name: auto\n    tools: \"*\"\n\nNote that since this is a prefix match and there could be other arguments, we don’t end the tool match pattern with a parentheses.",

To compensate, the web browser tool provides some additional context (a snippet of the page around the element_id being interacted with).\n\nThe bash() and python() tools take their input as a string, which especially for multi-line commands can be difficult to read and understand.

Agents are similar to solvers, but use a narrower interface that makes them much more versatile. A single agent can be:\n\nUsed as a top-level Solver for a task.\nRun as a standalone operation in an agent workflow.\nDelegated to in a multi-agent architecture.\nProvided as a standard Tool to a model\n\nThe agents module includes a flexible, general-purpose react agent, which can be used standalone or to orchestrate a multi agent system.\n\nExample\nThe following is a simple web_surfer() agent that uses the web_browser() tool to do open-ended web research.\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import Agent, AgentState, agent\nfrom inspect_ai.model import ChatMessageSystem, get_model\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import web_browser\n\n@agent\ndef web_surfer() -&gt; Agent:\n    async def execute(state: AgentState) -&gt; AgentState:\n        \"\"\"Web research assistant.\"\"\"\n      \n        # some general guidance for the agent\n        state.messages.append(\n            ChatMessageSystem(\n                content=\"You are an expert at using a \" + \n                \"web browser to answer questions.\"\n            )\n        )\n\n        # run a tool loop w/ the web_browser \n        messages, output = await get_model().generate_loop(\n            state.messages, tools=web_browser()\n        )\n\n        # update and return state\n        state.output = output\n        state.messages.extend(messages)\n        return state\n\n    return execute\nThe agent calls the generate_loop() function which runs the model in a loop until it stops calling tools. In this case the model may make several calls to the web_browser() tool to fulfil the request.\nWhile this example illustrates the basic mechanic of agents, you generally wouldn’t write a custom agent that does only this (a system prompt with a tool use loop) as the react() agent provides a more sophisticated and flexible version of this pattern. Here is the equivalent react() agent:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import react\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import web_browser\n\nweb_surfer = react(\n    name=\"web_surfer\",\n    description=\"Web research assistant\",\n    prompt=\"You are an expert at using a \" + \n           \"web browser to answer questions.\",\n    tools=web_browser()   \n)\nSee the ReAct Agent article for more details on using and customizing ReAct agents.\n\n\nUsing Agents\nAgents can be used in the following ways:\n\nAgents can be passed as a Solver to any Inspect interface that takes a solver:\nfrom inspect_ai import eval\n\neval(\"research_bench\", solver=web_surfer())\nFor other interfaces that aren’t aware of agents, you can use the as_solver() function to convert an agent to a solver.\nAgents can be executed directly using the run() function (you might do this in a multi-step agent workflow):\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import run\n\nstate = await run(\n    web_surfer(), \"What were the 3 most popular movies of 2020?\"\n)\nprint(f\"The most popular movies were: {state.output.completion}\")\nAgents can be used as a standard tool using the as_tool() function:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import as_tool\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import use_tools, generate\n\neval(\n    task=\"research_bench\", \n    solver=[\n        use_tools(as_tool(web_surfer())),\n        generate()\n    ]\n)\nprint(f\"The most popular movies were: {state.output.completion}\")\nAgents can participate in multi-agent systems where the conversation history is shared across agents. Use the handoff() function to create a tool that enables handing off the conversation from one agent to another:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import handoff\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import use_tools, generate\nfrom math_tools import addition\n\neval(\n    task=\"research_bench\", \n    solver=[\n        use_tools(addition(), handoff(web_surfer())),\n        generate()\n    ]\n)\nThe difference between handoff() and as_tool() is that handoff() forwards the entire conversation history to the agent (and enables the agent to add entries to it) whereas as_tool() provides a simple string in, string out interface to the agent.",

In fact, this is the full source code for the generate() solver:\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n    return await generate(state)\nThe self_critique() solver takes the ModelOutput and then sends it to another model for critique.

Also automatically substitutes any variables defined in sample metadata as well as any other custom named parameters passed in params.\nsystem_message()\nPrepend role=“system” message to the list of messages (will follow any other system messages it finds in the message stream).

Also automatically substitutes any variables defined in sample metadata and store, as well as any other custom named parameters passed in params.\nchain_of_thought()\nStandard chain of thought template with {prompt} substitution variable. Asks the model to provide the final answer on a line by itself at the end for easier scoring.\nuse_tools()\nDefine the set tools available for use by the model during generate().\ngenerate()\nAs illustrated above, just a simple call to generate(state). This is the default solver if no solver is specified.\nself_critique()\nPrompts the model to critique the results of a previous call to generate() (note that this need not be the same model as they one you are evaluating—use the model parameter to choose another model).

Also automatically substitutes any variables defined in sample metadata\nmultiple_choice()\nA solver which presents A,B,C,D style choices from input samples and calls generate() to yield model output.

First though there are some special considerations to be aware of when using the multiple_choice() solver:\n\nThe Sample must include the available choices. Choices should not include letters (as they are automatically included when presenting the choices to the model).\nThe Sample target should be a capital letter (e.g. A, B, C, D, etc.)\nYou should always pair it with the choice() scorer in your task definition. For custom answer parsing or scoring needs (like handling complex model outputs), implement a custom scorer.\nIt calls generate() internally, so you do need to separately include the generate() solver.\n\n\nExample\nBelow is a full example of reading a dataset for use with multiple choice() and using it in an evaluation task. The underlying data in mmlu.csv has the following form:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nA\nB\nC\nD\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\nFind the degree for the given field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.\n0\n4\n2\n6\nB\n\n\nLet p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3) in S_5 .

Note that you should not include letter prefixes in the choices, as they will be included automatically when presenting the question to the model.\n\n\nOptions\nThe following options are available for further customisation of the multiple choice solver:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntemplate\nUse template to provide an alternate prompt template (note that if you do this your template should handle prompting for multiple_correct directly if required). You can access the built in templates using the MultipleChoiceTemplate enum.\n\n\ncot\nWhether the solver should perform chain-of-thought reasoning before answering (defaults to False). NOTE: this has no effect if you provide a custom template.\n\n\nmultiple_correct\nBy default, multiple choice questions have a single correct answer. Set multiple_correct=True if your target has defined multiple correct answers (for example, a target of [\"B\", \"C\"]). In this case the model is prompted to provide one or more answers, and the sample is scored correct only if each of these answers are provided. NOTE: this has no effect if you provide a custom template.\n\n\n\n\n\nShuffling\nWhen working with datasets that contain multiple-choice options, you can randomize the order of these choices during data loading. The shuffling operation automatically updates any corresponding target values to maintain correct answer mappings.\nFor datasets that contain choices, you can shuffle the choices when the data is loaded. Shuffling choices will randomly re-order the choices and update the sample’s target value or values to align with the shuffled choices.\nThere are two ways to shuffle choices:\n# Method 1: Using the dataset method\ndataset = dataset.shuffle_choices()\n\n# Method 2: During dataset loading\ndataset = json_dataset(\"data.jsonl\", shuffle_choices=True)\nFor reproducible shuffling, you can specify a random seed:\n# Using a seed with the dataset method\ndataset = dataset.shuffle_choices(seed=42)\n\n# Using a seed during loading\ndataset = json_dataset(\"data.jsonl\", shuffle_choices=42)",

    "section": "Custom Solvers",
    "text": "Custom Solvers\nIn this section we’ll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in solvers as a jumping off point for implementing your own solvers. A solver is an implementation of the Solver protocol (a function that transforms a TaskState):\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n    # do something useful with state, possibly calling generate()\n    # for more advanced solvers\n    return state\nTypically solvers can be customised with parameters (e.g. template for prompt engineering solvers). This means that a Solver is actually a function which returns the solve() function referenced above (this will become more clear in the examples below).\n\nTask States\nBefore presenting the examples we’ll take a more in-depth look at the TaskState class. Task states consist of both lower level data members (e.g. messages, output) as well as a number of convenience properties. The core members of TaskState that are modified by solvers are messages / user_prompt and output:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nmessages\nlist[ChatMessage]\nChat conversation history for sample. It is automatically appended to by the generate() solver, and is often manipulated by other solvers (e.g. for prompt engineering or elicitation).\n\n\nuser_prompt\nChatMessageUser\nConvenience property for accessing the first user message in the message history (commonly used for prompt engineering).\n\n\noutput\nModelOutput\nThe ‘final’ model output once we’ve completed all solving. This field is automatically updated with the last “assistant” message by the generate() solver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the generate() solver automatically updates both the messages and output fields. For very simple evaluations modifying the user_prompt and then calling generate() encompasses all of the required interaction with TaskState.\n\n\n\nSometimes its important to have access to the original prompt input for the task (as other solvers may have re-written or even removed it entirely). This is available using the input and input_text properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninput\nstr | list[ChatMessage]\nOriginal Sample input.\n\n\ninput_text\nstr\nConvenience function for accessing the initial input from the Sample as a string.\n\n\n\nThere are several other fields used to provide contextual data from either the task sample or evaluation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsample_id\nint | str\nUnique ID for sample.\n\n\nepoch\nint\nEpoch for sample.\n\n\nmetadata\ndict\nOriginal metadata from Sample\n\n\nchoices\nlist[str] | None\nChoices from sample (used only in multiple-choice evals).\n\n\nmodel\nModelName\nName of model currently being evaluated.\n\n\n\nTask states also include available tools as well as guidance for the model on which tools to use (if you haven’t yet encountered the concept of tool use in language models, don’t worry about understanding these fields, the Tools article provides a more in-depth treatment):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntools\nlist[Tool]\nTools available to the model\n\n\ntool_choice\nToolChoice\nTool choice directive.\n\n\n\nThese fields are typically modified via the use_tools() solver, but they can also be modified directly for more advanced use cases.\n\n\nExample: Prompt Template\nHere’s the code for the prompt_template() solver:\n@solver\ndef prompt_template(template: str, **params: dict[str, Any]):\n\n    # determine the prompt template\n    prompt_template = resource(template)\n\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n        prompt = state.user_prompt\n        kwargs = state.metadata | params\n        prompt.text = prompt_template.format(prompt=prompt.text, **kwargs)\n        return state\n\n    return solve\nA few things to note about this implementation:\n\nThe function applies the @solver decorator—this registers the Solver with Inspect, making it possible to capture its name and parameters for logging, as well as make it callable from a configuration file (e.g. a YAML specification of an eval).\nThe solve() function is declared as async. This is so that it can participate in Inspect’s optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this solver doesn’t call generate() but others will).\nThe resource() function is used to read the specified template. This function accepts a string, file, or URL as its argument, and then returns a string with the contents of the resource.\nWe make use of the user_prompt property on the TaskState. This is a convenience property for locating the first role=\"user\" message (otherwise you might need to skip over system messages, etc). Since this is a string templating solver, we use the state.user_prompt.text property (so we are dealing with prompt as a string, recall that it can also be a list of messages).\nWe make sample metadata available to the template as well as any params passed to the function.\n\n\n\nExample: Self Critique\nHere’s the code for the self_critique() solver:\nDEFAULT_CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE = r\"\"\"\nGiven the following question and answer, please critique the answer.\nA good answer comprehensively answers the question and NEVER refuses\nto answer.

Use the get_model() function to get either the currently evaluated model or another model interface. For example:\n# use the model being evaluated for critique\ncritique_model = get_model() \n\n# use another model for critique\ncritique_model = get_model(\"google/gemini-2.5-pro\")\nUse the config parameter of get_model() to override default generation options:\ncritique_model = get_model(\n    \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\", \n    config = GenerateConfig(temperature = 0.9, max_connections = 10)\n)\n\n\nScoring in Solvers\nTypically, solvers don’t score samples but rather leave that to externally specified scorers. However, in some cases it is more convenient to have solvers also do scoring (e.g. when there is high coupling between the solver and scoring). The following two task state fields can be used for scoring:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntarget\nTarget\nScoring target from Sample\n\n\nscores\ndict[str, Score]\nOptional scores.\n\n\n\nHere is a trivial example of the code that might be used to yield scores from a solver:\nasync def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):\n    # ...perform solver work\n    \n    # score\n    correct = state.output.completion == state.target.text\n    state.scores = { \"correct\": Score(value=correct) }\n    return state\nNote that scores yielded by a Solver are combined with scores from the normal scoring provided by the scorer(s) defined for a Task.\n\n\nIntermediate Scoring\nIn some cases it is useful for a solver to score a task directly to generate an intermediate score or assist in deciding whether or how to continue. You can do this using the score function:\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import score\n\ndef solver_that_scores() -&gt; Solver:\n    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -&gt; TaskState:\n        \n        # use score(s) to determine next step\n        scores = await score(state)\n        \n        return state\n    \n    return solver\nNote that the score function returns a list of Score (as its possible that a task could have multiple scorers).\n\n\nConcurrency\nWhen creating custom solvers, it’s critical that you understand Inspect’s concurrency model. More specifically, if your solver is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review Parallelism for a more in depth discussion.",

For example, here we provide parameters (and default values) for system and grader prompts, as well as the grader model:\n\n\nsecurity.py\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import example_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, system_message\n\n@task\ndef security_guide(\n    system=\"devops.txt\", \n    grader=\"expert.txt\",\n    grader_model=\"openai/gpt-4o\"\n):\n   return Task(\n      dataset=example_dataset(\"security_guide\"),\n      solver=[system_message(system), generate()],\n      scorer=model_graded_fact(\n          template=grader, model=grader_model\n      )\n   )\n\nLet’s say we had an alternate system prompt in a file named \"researcher.txt\". We could run the task with this prompt as follows:\ninspect eval security.py -T system=\"researcher.txt\"\nThe -T CLI flag is used to specify parameter values. You can include multiple -T flags. For example:\ninspect eval security.py \\\n   -T system=\"researcher.txt\" -T grader=\"hacker.txt\"\nIf you have several task parameters you want to specify together, you can put them in a YAML or JSON file and use the --task-config CLI option.

    "text": "Solvers\nWhile tasks always include a default solver, you can also vary the solver to explore other strategies and elicitation techniques. This section covers best practices for creating solver-independent tasks.\n\nSolver Parameter\nYou can substitute an alternate solver for the solver that is built in to your Task using the --solver command line parameter (or solver argument to the eval() function).\nFor example, let’s start with a simple CTF challenge task:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import generate, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash, python\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\n\n@task\ndef ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            use_tools([\n                bash(timeout=180), \n                python(timeout=180)\n            ]),\n            generate()\n        ],\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n        scorer=includes()\n    )\nThis task uses the most naive solver possible (a simple tool use loop with no additional elicitation). That might be okay for initial task development, but we’ll likely want to try lots of different strategies. We start by breaking the solver into its own function and adding an alternative solver that uses a react() agent\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import react\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset._dataset import Sample\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import chain, generate, solver, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash, python\n\n\n@solver\ndef ctf_tool_loop():\n    return chain([\n        use_tools([\n            bash(timeout=180), \n            python(timeout=180)\n        ]),\n        generate()\n    ])\n\n@solver\ndef ctf_agent(attempts: int = 3):\n    return react(\n        tools=[bash(timeout=180), python(timeout=180)],\n        attempts=attempts,\n    )\n\n \n@task\ndef ctf():\n    # return task\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=ctf_tool_loop(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n        scorer=includes(),\n    )\nNote that we use the chain() function to combine multiple solvers into a composite one.\nYou can now switch between solvers when running the evaluation:\n# run with the default solver (ctf_tool_loop)\ninspect eval ctf.py \n\n# run with the ctf agent solver\ninspect eval ctf.py --solver=ctf_agent\n\n# run with a different attempts\ninspect eval ctf.py --solver=ctf_agent -S attempts=5\nNote the use of the -S CLI option to pass an alternate value for attempts to the ctf_agent() solver.\n\n\nSetup Parameter\nIn some cases, there will be important steps in the setup of a task that should not be substituted when another solver is used with the task. For example, you might have a step that does dynamic prompt engineering based on values in the sample metadata or you might have a step that initialises resources in a sample’s sandbox.\nIn these scenarios you can define a setup solver that is always run even when another solver is substituted. For example, here we adapt our initial example to include a setup step:\n# prompt solver which should always be run\n@solver\ndef ctf_prompt():\n    async def solve(state, generate):\n        # TODO: dynamic prompt engineering\n        return state\n\n    return solve\n\n@task\ndef ctf(solver: Solver | None = None):\n    # use default tool loop solver if no solver specified\n    if solver is None:\n        solver = ctf_tool_loop()\n   \n    # return task\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        setup=ctf_prompt(),\n        solver=solver,\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n        scorer=includes()\n    )",

    "text": "Task Reuse\nThe basic mechanism for task re-use is to create flexible and adaptable base @task functions (which often have many parameters) and then derive new higher-level tasks from them by creating additional @task functions that call the base function.\nIn some cases though you might not have full control over the base @task function (e.g. it’s published in a Python package you aren’t the maintainer of) but you nevertheless want to flexibly create derivative tasks from it. To do this, you can use the task_with() function, which provides a straightforward way to modify the properties of an existing task.\nFor example, imagine you are dealing with a Task that hard-codes its sandbox to a particular Dockerfile included with the task, and further hard codes its solver to a simple agent:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import react\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import includes\n\n@task\ndef hard_coded():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=react(tools=[bash()]),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"compose.yaml\"),\n        scorer=includes()\n    )\nUsing task_with(), you can adapt this task to use a different solver and sandbox entirely. For example, here we import the original hard_coded() task from a hypothetical ctf_tasks package and provide it with a different solver and sandbox, as well as give it a message_limit (which we in turn also expose as a parameter of the adapted task):\nfrom inspect_ai import task, task_with\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import solver\n\nfrom ctf_tasks import hard_coded\n\n@solver\ndef my_custom_agent():\n    ## custom agent implementation\n    ...\n\n@task\ndef adapted(message_limit: int = 20):\n    return task_with(\n        hard_coded(),  # original task definition\n        solver=my_custom_agent(),\n        sandbox=(\"docker\", \"custom-compose.yaml\"),\n        message_limit=message_limit\n    )\nTasks are recipes for an evaluation and represent the convergence of many considerations (datasets, solvers, sandbox environments, limits, and scoring). Task variations often lie at the intersection of these, and the task_with() function is intended to help you produce exactly the variation you need for a given evaluation.\nNote that task_with() modifies the passed task in-place, so if you want to create multiple variations of a single task using task_with() you should create the underlying task multiple times (once for each call to task_with()). For example:\nadapted1 = task_with(hard_coded(), ...)\nadapted2 = task_with(hard_coded(), ...)",

Math expressions can be logically equivalent but not literally the same. Consequently, we’ll use a model to assess whether the output and the target are logically equivalent. the expression_equivalence() custom scorer implements this:\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef expression_equivalence():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        # extract answer\n        match = re.search(AnswerPattern.LINE, state.output.completion)\n        if match:\n            # ask the model to judge equivalence\n            answer = match.group(1)\n            prompt = EQUIVALENCE_TEMPLATE % (\n                {\"expression1\": target.text, \"expression2\": answer}\n            )\n            result = await get_model().generate(prompt)\n\n            # return the score\n            correct = result.completion.lower() == \"yes\"\n            return Score(\n                value=CORRECT if correct else INCORRECT,\n                answer=answer,\n                explanation=state.output.completion,\n            )\n        else:\n            return Score(\n                value=INCORRECT,\n                explanation=\"Answer not found in model output: \"\n                + f\"{state.output.completion}\",\n            )\n\n    return score\n\nWe are making a separate call to the model to assess equivalence. We prompt for this using an EQUIVALENCE_TEMPLATE. Here’s a general flavor for how that template looks (there are more examples in the real template):\nEQUIVALENCE_TEMPLATE = r\"\"\"\nLook at the following two expressions (answers to a math problem)\nand judge whether they are equivalent.

Tools are Python functions that you provide for the model to call for assistance with various tasks (e.g. looking up information). Note that tools are actually executed on the client system, not on the system where the model is running.\nNote that tool use is not supported for every model provider. Currently, tools work with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, and Groq models.\nIf you want to use tools in your evals it’s worth taking some time to learn how to provide good tool definitions. Here are some resources you may find helpful:\n\nFunction Calling with LLMs\nBest Practices for Tool Definitions\n\n\nAddition\nWe’ll demonstrate with a simple tool that adds two numbers, using the @tool decorator to register it with the system:\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import match\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (\n    generate, use_tools\n)\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import tool\n\n@tool\ndef add():\n    async def execute(x: int, y: int):\n        \"\"\"\n        Add two numbers.\n\n        Args:\n            x: First number to add.\n            y: Second number to add.\n\n        Returns:\n            The sum of the two numbers.\n        \"\"\"\n        return x + y\n\n    return execute\n\nNote that we provide type annotations for both arguments:\nasync def execute(x: int, y: int)\nFurther, we provide descriptions for each parameter in the documentation comment:\nArgs:\n    x: First number to add.\n    y: Second number to add.\nType annotations and descriptions are required for tool declarations so that the model can be informed which types to pass back to the tool function and what the purpose of each parameter is.\nNow that we’ve defined the tool, we can use it in an evaluation by passing it to the use_tools() function.\n\n@task\ndef addition_problem():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=[Sample(\n            input=\"What is 1 + 1?\",\n            target=[\"2\", \"2.0\"]\n        )],\n        solver=[use_tools(add()), generate()],\n        scorer=match(numeric=True),\n    )\n\nWe run the eval with:\ninspect eval addition_problem.py",

The model is given access to bash() and python() tools within a sandboxed Docker container, and must discover the value of the flag within a set number of message turns.\n\nTask\nThe definition of the task calls out to a couple of helper functions that do most of the heavy lifting:\n\nread_dataset(), which reads samples from the file system. Note that samples include both instructions and files to copy into the secure sandbox. See the full source code of this example for details.\n\n\nctf_agent(), which defines an agent that will be use as the task’s solver. The agent consists principally of using bash() and python() tools in a loop until the flag is discovered. We’ll describe this function in more detail below.\n\n\nfrom dataset import read_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\n\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf(attempts=3, message_limit=30, shuffle=False):\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(shuffle),\n        solver=ctf_agent(attempts),\n        message_limit=message_limit,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\n\nNote that we specify sandbox=\"docker\" to ensure that code generated from the model is run in a secure sandbox environment.\nHere is the definition of the agent:\n\nfrom textwrap import dedent\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import react\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash, python\n\n@agent\ndef ctf_agent(attempts=3):\n    PROMPT = dedent(\"\"\"\n    You are a Capture the Flag (CTF) player, and you are interacting with a\n    standard Ubuntu machine with bash commands.

As demonstrated above, agents can be used as solvers, but have additional capabilities related to composing agents together into multi-agent systems. For now, think of an agent as a type of solver (see the Agents documentation to learn more about agents).\nThe react() agent in particular provides a ReAct tool loop with support for retries and encouraging the model to continue if its gives up or gets stuck. The bash() and python() tools are provided to the model with a 3-minute timeout to prevent long running commands from getting the evaluation stuck.",

This enables you to equip models with your own set of custom tools so they can perform a wider variety of tasks.\nInspect natively supports registering Python functions as tools and providing these tools to models that support them. Inspect also includes several standard tools for code execution, text editing, computer use, web search, and web browsing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTools and Agents\n\n\n\nOne application of tools is to run them within an agent scaffold that pursues an objective over multiple interactions with a model. The scaffold uses the model to help make decisions about which tools to use and when, and orchestrates calls to the model to use the tools. This is covered in more depth in the Agents section.",

If your tool does do more elaborate things, you’ll want to make sure it plays well with Inspect’s concurrency scheme. For network requests, this amounts to using async HTTP calls with httpx. For heavier computation, tools should use subprocesses as described in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that when using tools with models, the models do not call the Python function directly.

For example, you might want to:\n\nAdd another termination condition for the output satisfying some criteria.\nAdd a critique / reflection step between tool calling and generate.\nUrge the model to keep going after it decides to stop calling tools.\nHandle context window overflow (stop_reason==\"model_length\") by truncating or summarising the messages.\nExamine and possibly filter the tool calls before invoking execute_tools()\n\nFor example, you might implement automatic context window truncation in response to context window overflow:\n# check for context window overflow\nif state.output.stop_reason == \"model_length\":\n    if overflow is not None:\n        state.messages = trim_messages(state.messages)\n        continue\nNote that the standard react() agent provides some of these agent loop enhancements (urging the model to continue and handling context window overflow).",

This can be accomplished in Inspect using the Store, which provides a sample-scoped scratchpad for arbitrary values.\n\nTyped Store\nWhen developing agents, you should use the typed-interface to the per-sample store, which provides both type-checking and namespacing for store access.\nFor example, here we define a typed accessor to the store by deriving from the StoreModel class (which in turn derives from Pydantic BaseModel):\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom inspect_ai.util import StoreModel\n\nclass Activity(StoreModel):\n    active: bool = Field(default=False)\n    tries: int = Field(default=0)\n    actions: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\nWe can then get access to a sample scoped instance of the store for use in agents using the store_as() function:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import store_as\n\nactivity = store_as(Activity)\n\n\nAgent Instances\nIf you want an agent to have a store-per-instance by default, add an instance parameter to your @agent function and pass it a unique value. Then, forward the instance on to store_as() as well as any tools you call that are also stateful (e.g. web_browser()). For example:\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom shortuuid import uuid\n\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import Agent, agent\nfrom inspect_ai.model import ChatMessage\nfrom inspect_ai.util import StoreModel, store_as\n\nclass WebSurferState(StoreModel):\n    messages: list[ChatMessage] = Field(default_factory=list)\n\n@agent\ndef web_surfer(instance: str | None = None) -&gt; Agent:\n    \n    async def execute(state: AgentState) -&gt; AgentState:\n\n        # get state for this instance\n        surfer_state = store_as(WebSurferState, instance=instance)\n\n        ...\n\n        # pass the instance on to web_browser \n        messages, state.output = await get_model().generate_loop(\n            state.messages, tools=web_browser(instance=instance)\n        )\nThen, pass a unique id as the instance:\n\nfrom shortuuid import uuid\n\nreact(..., tools=[web_surfer(instance=uuid())])\n\nThis enables you to have multiple instances of the web_surfer() agent, each with their own state and web browser.\n\n\nNamed Instances\nIt’s also possible that you’ll want to create various named store instances that are shared across agents (e.g. each participant in a game might need their own store). Use the instance parameter of store_as() to explicitly create scoped store accessors:\nred_team_activity = store_as(Activity, instance=\"red_team\")\nblue_team_activity = store_as(Activity, instance=\"blue_team\")",

It is also possible to specify limits when executing an agent using any of the techniques described above.\nTo run an agent with one or more limits, pass the limit object in the limits argument to a function like handoff(), as_tool(), as_solver() or run() (see Using Agents for details on the various ways to run agents).\nHere we limit an agent we are including as a solver to 500K tokens:\neval(\n    task=\"research_bench\", \n    solver=as_solver(web_surfer(), limits=[token_limit(1024*500)])\n)\nHere we limit an agent handoff() to 500K tokens:\neval(\n    task=\"research_bench\", \n    solver=[\n        use_tools(\n            addition(),\n            handoff(web_surfer(), limits=[token_limit(1024*500)]),\n        ),\n        generate()\n    ]\n)\n\nLimit Exceeded\nNote that when limits are exceeded during an agent’s execution, the way this is handled differs depending on how the agent was executed:\n\nFor agents used via as_solver(), if a limit is exceeded then the sample will terminate (this is exactly how sample-level limits work).\nFor agents that are run() directly with limits, their limit exceptions will be caught and returned in a tuple. Limits other than the ones passed to run() will propagate up the stack.\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import run\n\nstate, limit_error = await run(\n    agent=web_surfer(), \n    input=\"What were the 3 most popular movies of 2020?\",\n    limits=[token_limit(1024*500)])\n)\nif limit_error:\n    ...\nFor tool based agents (handoff() and as_tool()), if a limit is exceeded then a message to that effect is returned to the model but the sample continues running.",

To use these tools in Inspect, you first define a connection to an MCP Server then pass the server on to Inspect functions that take tools as an argument.\n\n\nFor example, here we create a connection to a Git MCP Server, and then pass it to a react() agent used as a solver for a task:\nfrom inspect_ai import task\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import react\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import mcp_server_stdio\n\n@task\ndef git_task():\n    git_server = mcp_server_stdio(\n        name=\"Git\",\n        command=\"python3\", \n        args=[\"-m\", \"mcp_server_git\", \"--repository\", \".\"]\n    )\n\n    return Task(\n        dataset=[Sample(\n            \"What is the git status of the working directory?\"\n        )],\n        solver=react(tools=[git_server])\n    )\nThe Git MCP server provides various tools for interacting with Git (e.g. git_status(), git_diff(), git_log(), etc.). By passing the git_server instance to the agent we make these tools available to it. You can also filter the list of tools (which is covered below in Tool Selection).",

    "text": "MCP Servers\nMCP servers can use a variety of transports. There are two transports built-in to the core implementation:\n\nStandard I/O (stdio). The stdio transport enables communication to a local process through standard input and output streams.\nHTTP Servers (http). The http transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication, typically to a remote host.\n\nIn addition, the Inspect implementation of MCP adds another transport:\n\nSandbox (sandbox). The sandbox transport enables communication to a process running in an Inspect sandbox through standard input and output streams.\n\nYou can use the following functions to create interfaces to the various types of servers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmcp_server_stdio()\nStdio interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers that run locally.\n\n\nmcp_server_http()\nHTTP interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers available via a URL endpoint.\n\n\nmcp_server_sandbox()\nSandbox interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers that run in an Inspect sandbox.\n\n\nmcp_server_sse()\nSSE interface to MCP server (Note that the SSE interface has been deprecated)\n\n\n\nWe’ll cover using stdio and http based servers in the section below. Sandbox servers require some additional container configuration, and are covered separately in Sandboxes.\n\nServer Command\nFor stdio servers, you need to provide the command to start the server along with potentially some command line arguments and environment variables. For sse servers you’ll generally provide a host name and headers with credentials.\nServers typically provide their documentation in the JSON format required by the claude_desktop_config.json file in Claude Desktop. For example, here is the documentation for configuring the Google Maps server:\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"google-maps\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps\"\n      ],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY\": \"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nWhen using MCP servers with Inspect, you only need to provide the inner arguments. For example, to use the Google Maps server with Inspect:\nmaps_server = mcp_server_stdio(\n    name=\"Google Maps\",\n    command=\"npx\", \n    args=[\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps\"],\n    env={ \"GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY\": \"&lt;YOUR_API_KEY&gt;\" }\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNode.js Prerequisite\n\n\n\nThe \"command\": \"npx\" option indicates that this server was written using Node.js (other servers may be written in Python and use \"command\": \"python3\"). Using Node.js based MCP servers requires that you install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download).\n\n\n\n\nServer Tools\nEach MCP server makes available a set of tools. For example, the Google Maps server includes 7 tools (e.g. maps_search_places() , maps_place_details(), etc.). You can make these tools available to Inspect by passing the server interface alongside other standard tools. For example:\n@task\ndef map_task():\n    maps_server = mcp_server_stdio(\n        name=\"Google Maps\",\n        command=\"npx\", \n        args=[\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps\"]\n    )\n\n    return Task(\n        dataset=[Sample(\n            \"Where can I find a good comic book store in London?\"\n        )],\n        solver=react(tools=[maps_server])\n    )\nIn this example we use all of the tool made available by the server. You can also select a subset of tools (this is covered below in Tool Selection).\n\nToolSource\nThe MCPServer interface is a ToolSource, which is a new interface for dynamically providing a set of tools. Inspect generation methods that take Tool or ToolDef now also take ToolSource.\nIf you are creating your own agents or functions that take tools arguments, we recommend you do this same if you are going to be using MCP servers. For example:\n@agent\ndef my_agent(tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolDef | ToolSource]):\n    ...",

This is especially useful for scenarios where you want the model to make a series of tool calls in a single generation (e.g. when you want to provide custom tools to a deep research model).\nYou can specify that you’d like an HTTP-based MCP Server to be executed remotely by passing the execution=\"remote\" option. For example:\ndeepwiki = mcp_server_http(\n    name=\"deepwiki\", \n    url=\"https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp\", \n    authorization=\"$DEEPWIKI_API_KEY\"\n1    execution=\"remote\"\n)\n\n1\n\nThis is what indicates that the MCP Server should be executed remotely. Pass execution=\"local\" for local execution (the default).\n\n\nNote that some remote MCP servers will require credentials—in this case pass the authorization option (as shown above) to provide an OAuth Bearer Token or pass headers to provide credentials using another scheme.\nBefore using remote servers, you should review OpenAI’s Risks and Safety guidance for Remote MCP.",

    "text": "Connections\nMCP Servers can be either stateless or stateful. Stateful servers may retain context in memory whereas stateless servers either have no state or operate on external state. For example the Brave Search server is stateless (it just processes one search at a time) whereas the Knowledge Graph Memory server is stateful (it maintains a knowledge graph in memory).\nIn the case that you using stateful servers, you will want to establish a longer running connection to the server so that it’s state is maintained across calls. You can do this using the mcp_connection() context manager.\n\nReAct Agent\nThe mcp_connection() context manager is used automatically by the react() agent, with the server connection being maintained for the duration of the agent loop.\nFor example, the following will establish a single connection to the memory server and preserve its state across calls:\nmemory_server = mcp_server_stdio(\n    name=\"Memory\",\n    command=\"npx\", \n    args=[\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory\"]\n)\n\nreturn Task(\n    ...,\n    solver=react(tools=[memory_server])\n)\n\n\nCustom Agents\nFor general purpose custom agents, you will also likely want to use the mcp_connection() connect manager to preserve connection state throughout your tool use loop. For example, here is a web surfer agent that uses a web browser along with a memory server:\n@agent\ndef web_surfer() -&gt; Agent:\n    async def execute(state: AgentState) -&gt; AgentState:\n        \"\"\"Web research assistant.\"\"\"\n      \n        # some general guidance for the agent\n        state.messages.append(\n            ChatMessageSystem(\n                content=\"You are a tenacious web researcher that is \"\n                + \"expert at using a web browser to answer questions. \"\n                + \"Use the memory tools to track your research.\"\n            )\n        )\n\n        # interface to memory server\n        memory_server = mcp_server_stdio(\n            name=\"Memory\",\n            command=\"npx\", \n            args=[\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory\"]\n        )\n\n        # run tool loop w/ then update & return state\n        async with mcp_connection(memory_server):\n            messages, state.output = await get_model().generate_loop(\n                state.messages, tools=web_browser() + [memory_server]\n            )\n            state.messages.extend(messages)\n            return state\n\n    return execute\n```\nNote that the mcp_connection() function can take an arbitrary list of tools and will discover and connect to any MCP-based ToolSource in the list. So if your agent takes a tools parameter you can just forward it on. For example:\n@agent\ndef my_agent(tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolDef | ToolSource]):\n    async def execute(state: AgentState):\n       async with mcp_connection(tools):\n           # tool use loop\n           ...",

Below is a summary of these scorers. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the Go to Definition command in your source editor.\n\nincludes()\nDetermine whether the target from the Sample appears anywhere inside the model output. Can be case sensitive or insensitive (defaults to the latter).\nmatch()\nDetermine whether the target from the Sample appears at the beginning or end of model output (defaults to looking at the end). Has options for ignoring case, white-space, and punctuation (all are ignored by default).\npattern()\nExtract the answer from model output using a regular expression.\nanswer()\nScorer for model output that preceded answers with “ANSWER:”. Can extract letters, words, or the remainder of the line.\nexact()\nScorer which will normalize the text of the answer and target(s) and perform an exact matching comparison of the text. This scorer will return CORRECT when the answer is an exact match to one or more targets.\nf1()\nScorer which computes the F1 score for the answer (which balances recall precision by taking the harmonic mean between recall and precision).\nmodel_graded_qa()\nHave another model assess whether the model output is a correct answer based on the grading guidance contained in target. Has a built-in template that can be customised.\nmodel_graded_fact()\nHave another model assess whether the model output contains a fact that is set out in target. This is a more narrow assessment than model_graded_qa(), and is used when model output is too complex to be assessed using a simple match() or pattern() scorer.\nchoice()\nSpecialised scorer that is used with the multiple_choice() solver.\n\nScorers provide one or more built-in metrics (each of the scorers above provides accuracy and stderr as a metric). You can also provide your own custom metrics in Task definitions. For example:\nTask(\n    dataset=dataset,\n    solver=[\n        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n        multiple_choice()\n    ],\n    scorer=match(),\n    metrics=[custom_metric()]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe current development version of Inspect replaces the use of the bootstrap_stderr metric with stderr for the built in scorers enumerated above.\nSince eval scores are means of numbers having finite variance, we can compute standard errors using the Central Limit Theorem rather than bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is generally useful in contexts with more complex structure or non-mean summary statistics (e.g. quantiles). You will notice that the bootstrap numbers will come in quite close to the analytic numbers, since they are estimating the same thing.\nA common misunderstanding is that “t-tests require the underlying data to be normally distributed”. This is only true for small-sample problems; for large sample problems (say 30 or more questions), you just need finite variance in the underlying data and the CLT guarantees a normally distributed mean value.",

The built-in model graded scorers can be customised in several ways—you can also create entirely new model scorers (see the model graded example below for a starting point).\nHere is the declaration for the model_graded_qa() function:\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_graded_qa(\n    template: str | None = None,\n    instructions: str | None = None,\n    grade_pattern: str | None = None,\n    include_history: bool | Callable[[TaskState], str] = False,\n    partial_credit: bool = False,\n    model: list[str | Model] | str | Model | None = None,\n    model_role: str | None = \"grader\",\n) -&gt; Scorer:\n    ...\nThe default model graded QA scorer is tuned to grade answers to open ended questions. The default template and instructions ask the model to produce a grade in the format GRADE: C or GRADE: I, and this grade is extracted using the default grade_pattern regular expression.\nModel selection follows this precedence:\n\nIf model is provided, it is used (if a list is provided, each model grades independently and the final grade is by majority vote).\nElse if model_role is provided (default: \"grader\"), the model bound to that role (via eval(..., model_roles={...}) or --model-role grader=...) is used.\nElse the model currently being evaluated is used.\n\nThere are a few ways you can customise the default behaviour:\n\nProvide alternate instructions—the default instructions ask the model to use chain of thought reasoning and provide grades in the format GRADE: C or GRADE: I. Note that if you provide instructions that ask the model to format grades in a different way, you will also want to customise the grade_pattern.\nSpecify include_history = True to include the full chat history in the presented question (by default only the original sample input is presented). You may optionally instead pass a function that enables customising the presentation of the chat history.\nSpecify partial_credit = True to prompt the model to assign partial credit to answers that are not entirely right but come close (metrics by default convert this to a value of 0.5). Note that this parameter is only valid when using the default instructions.\nSpecify an alternate model to perform the grading (e.g. a more powerful model or a model fine tuned for grading). If you provide a list of models, each grades independently and the final grade is chosen by majority vote.\nBind a model_role (default: \"grader\") at eval time. See Model Roles for details.\nSpecify a different template—note that templates are passed these variables: question, criterion, answer, and instructions.\n\nThe model_graded_fact() scorer works identically to model_graded_qa() (including model selection precedence and multi-model voting), and simply provides an alternate template oriented around judging whether a fact is included in the model output.\nIf you want to understand how the default templates for model_graded_qa() and model_graded_fact() work, see their source code.\n\nMultiple Models\nThe built-in model graded scorers also support using multiple grader models (whereby the final grade is chosen by majority vote). For example, here we specify that 3 models should be used for grading:\nmodel_graded_qa(\n    model = [\n        \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n        \"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\" \n        \"together/meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf\",\n    ]\n)\nThe implementation of multiple grader models takes advantage of the multi_scorer() and majority_vote() functions, both of which can be used in your own scorers (as described in the Multiple Scorers section below).",

When creating custom scorers, it’s critical that you understand Inspect’s concurrency model. More specifically, if your scorer is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review Parallelism before proceeding.\n\n\n\n\nScore\nThe components of Score include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nvalue\nValue\nValue assigned to the sample (e.g. “C” or “I”, or a raw numeric value).\n\n\nanswer\nstr\nText extracted from model output for comparison (optional).\n\n\nexplanation\nstr\nExplanation of score, e.g. full model output or grader model output (optional).\n\n\nmetadata\ndict[str,Any]\nAdditional metadata about the score to record in the log file (optional).\n\n\n\nFor example, the following are all valid Score objects:\nScore(value=\"C\")\nScore(value=\"I\")\nScore(value=0.6)\nScore(\n    value=\"C\" if extracted == target.text else \"I\", \n    answer=extracted, \n    explanation=state.output.completion\n)\nIf you are extracting an answer from within a completion (e.g. looking for text using a regex pattern, looking at the beginning or end of the completion, etc.) you should strive to always return an answer as part of your Score, as this makes it much easier to understand the details of scoring when viewing the eval log file.\n\n\nValue\nValue is union over the main scalar types as well as a list or dict of the same types:\nValue = Union[\n    str | int | float | bool,\n    Sequence[str | int | float | bool],\n    Mapping[str, str | int | float | bool],\n]\nThe vast majority of scorers will use str (e.g. for correct/incorrect via “C” and “I”) or float (the other types are there to meet more complex scenarios). One thing to keep in mind is that whatever Value type you use in a scorer must be supported by the metrics declared for the scorer (more on this below).\nNext, we’ll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in scorers as a jumping off point for implementing your own scorers. If you are working on custom scorers, you should also review the Scorer Workflow section below for tips on optimising your development process.\n\n\nModels in Scorers\nYou’ll often want to use models in the implementation of scorers. Use the get_model() function to get either the currently evaluated model or another model interface. For example:\n# use the model being evaluated for grading\ngrader_model = get_model() \n\n# use another model for grading\ngrader_model = get_model(\"google/gemini-2.5-pro\")\nUse the config parameter of get_model() to override default generation options:\ngrader_model = get_model(\n    \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\", \n    config = GenerateConfig(temperature = 0.9, max_connections = 10)\n)\n\n\nExample: Includes\nHere is the source code for the built-in includes() scorer:\n1@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef includes(ignore_case: bool = True):\n\n2    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n\n        # check for correct\n        answer = state.output.completion\n3        target = target.text\n        if ignore_case:\n            correct = answer.lower().rfind(target.lower()) != -1\n        else:\n            correct = answer.rfind(target) != -1\n\n        # return score\n        return Score(\n4            value = CORRECT if correct else INCORRECT,\n5            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\n1\n\nThe function applies the @scorer decorator and registers two metrics for use with the scorer.\n\n2\n\nThe score function is declared as async. This is so that it can participate in Inspect’s optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this scorer doesn’t call a model but others will).\n\n3\n\nWe make use of the text property on the Target. This is a convenience property to get a simple text value out of the Target (as targets can technically be a list of strings).\n\n4\n\nWe use the special constants CORRECT and INCORRECT for the score value (as the accuracy(), stderr(), and bootstrap_stderr() metrics know how to convert these special constants to float values (1.0 and 0.0 respectively).\n\n5\n\nWe provide the full model completion as the answer for the score (answer is optional, but highly recommended as it is often useful to refer to during evaluation development).\n\n\n\n\nExample: Model Grading\nHere’s a somewhat simplified version of the code for the model_graded_qa() scorer:\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])\ndef model_graded_qa(\n    template: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_TEMPLATE,\n    instructions: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_INSTRUCTIONS,\n    grade_pattern: str = DEFAULT_GRADE_PATTERN,\n    model: str | Model | None = None,\n) -&gt; Scorer:\n   \n    # resolve grading template and instructions, \n    # (as they could be file paths or URLs)\n    template = resource(template)\n    instructions = resource(instructions)\n\n    # resolve model\n    grader_model = get_model(model)\n\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target) -&gt; Score:\n        # format the model grading template\n        score_prompt = template.format(\n            question=state.input_text,\n            answer=state.output.completion,\n            criterion=target.text,\n            instructions=instructions,\n        )\n\n        # query the model for the score\n        result = await grader_model.generate(score_prompt)\n\n        # extract the grade\n        match = re.search(grade_pattern, result.completion)\n        if match:\n            return Score(\n                value=match.group(1),\n                answer=match.group(0),\n                explanation=result.completion,\n            )\n        else:\n            return Score(\n                value=INCORRECT,\n                explanation=\"Grade not found in model output: \"\n                + f\"{result.completion}\",\n            )\n\n    return score\nNote that the call to model_grader.generate() is done with await—this is critical to ensure that the scorer participates correctly in the scheduling of generation work.\nNote also we use the input_text property of the TaskState to access a string version of the original user input to substitute it into the grading template. Using the input_text has two benefits: (1) It is guaranteed to cover the original input from the dataset (rather than a transformed prompt in messages); and (2) It normalises the input to a string (as it could have been a message list).",

    "text": "Multiple Scorers\nThere are several ways to use multiple scorers in an evaluation:\n\nYou can provide a list of scorers in a Task definition (this is the best option when scorers are entirely independent)\nYou can yield multiple scores from a Scorer (this is the best option when scores share code and/or expensive computations).\nYou can use multiple scorers and then aggregate them into a single scorer (e.g. majority voting).\n\n\nList of Scorers\nTask definitions can specify multiple scorers. For example, the below task will use two different models to grade the results, storing two scores with each sample, one for each of the two models:\nTask(\n    dataset=dataset,\n    solver=[\n        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n        generate()\n    ],\n    scorer=[\n        model_graded_qa(model=\"openai/gpt-4\"), \n        model_graded_qa(model=\"google/gemini-2.5-pro\")\n    ],\n)\nThis is useful when there is more than one way to score a result and you would like preserve the individual score values with each sample (versus reducing the multiple scores to a single value).\n\n\nScorer with Multiple Values\nYou may also create a scorer which yields multiple scores. This is useful when the scores use data that is shared or expensive to compute. For example:\n@scorer(\n1    metrics={\n        \"a_count\": [mean(), stderr()],\n        \"e_count\": [mean(), stderr()]\n    }\n)\ndef letter_count():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        answer = state.output.completion\n        a_count = answer.count(\"a\")\n        e_count = answer.count(\"e\")\n2        return Score(\n            value={\"a_count\": a_count, \"e_count\": e_count},\n            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=[Sample(input=\"Tell me a story.\"],\n    scorer=letter_count()\n)\n\n1\n\nThe metrics for this scorer are a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name).\n\n2\n\nThe score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the @scorer decorator.\n\n\nThe above example will produce two scores, a_count and e_count, each of which will have metrics for mean and stderr.\nWhen working with complex score values and metrics, you may use globs as keys for mapping metrics to scores. For example, a more succinct way to write the previous example:\n@scorer(\n    metrics={\n        \"*\": [mean(), stderr()], \n    }\n)\nGlob keys will each be resolved and a complete list of matching metrics will be applied to each score key. For example to compute mean for all score keys, and only compute stderr for e_count you could write:\n@scorer(\n    metrics={\n        \"*\": [mean()], \n        \"e_count\": [stderr()]\n    }\n)\n\n\nScorer with Complex Metrics\nSometime, it is useful for a scorer to compute multiple values (returning a dictionary as the score value) and to have metrics computed both for each key in the score dictionary, but also for the dictionary as a whole. For example:\n@scorer(\n1    metrics=[{\n        \"a_count\": [mean(), stderr()],\n        \"e_count\": [mean(), stderr()]\n    }, total_count()]\n)\ndef letter_count():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        answer = state.output.completion\n        a_count = answer.count(\"a\")\n        e_count = answer.count(\"e\")\n2        return Score(\n            value={\"a_count\": a_count, \"e_count\": e_count},\n            answer=answer\n        )\n\n    return score\n\n@metric\ndef total_count() -&gt; Metric:\n    def metric(scores: list[SampleScore]) -&gt; int | float:\n        total = 0.0\n        for score in scores:\n3            total = score.score.value[\"a_count\"]\n                + score.score.value[\"e_count\"]\n        return total\n    return metric\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=[Sample(input=\"Tell me a story.\"],\n    scorer=letter_count()\n)\n\n1\n\nThe metrics for this scorer are a list, one element is a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name), the other element is a Metric which will receive the entire score dictionary.\n\n2\n\nThe score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the @scorer decorator.\n\n3\n\nThe total_count metric will compute a metric based upon the entire score dictionary (since it isn’t being mapped onto the dictionary by key)\n\n\n\n\nReducing Multiple Scores\nIt’s possible to use multiple scorers in parallel, then reduce their output into a final overall score. This is done using the multi_scorer() function. For example, this is roughly how the built in model graders use multiple models for grading:\nmulti_scorer(\n    scorers = [model_graded_qa(model=model) for model in models],\n    reducer = \"mode\"\n)\nUse of multi_scorer() requires both a list of scorers as well as a reducer which determines how a list of scores will be turned into a single score. In this case we use the “mode” reducer which returns the score that appeared most frequently in the answers.\n\n\nSandbox Access\nIf your Solver is an Agent with tool use, you might want to inspect the contents of the tool sandbox to score the task.\nThe contents of the sandbox for the Sample are available to the scorer; simply call await sandbox().read_file() (or .exec()).\nFor example:\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import Score, Target, accuracy, scorer\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import Plan, TaskState, generate, use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import bash\nfrom inspect_ai.util import sandbox\n\n\n@scorer(metrics=[accuracy()])\ndef check_file_exists():\n    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):\n        try:\n            _ = await sandbox().read_file(target.text)\n            exists = True\n        except FileNotFoundError:\n            exists = False\n        return Score(value=1 if exists else 0)\n\n    return score\n\n\n@task\ndef challenge() -&gt; Task:\n    return Task(\n        dataset=[\n            Sample(\n                input=\"Create a file called hello-world.txt\",\n                target=\"hello-world.txt\",\n            )\n        ],\n        solver=[use_tools([bash()]), generate()],\n        sandbox=\"local\",\n        scorer=check_file_exists(),\n    )",

    "title": "Scorers",
    "section": "Scoring Metrics",
    "text": "Scoring Metrics\nEach scorer provides one or more built-in metrics (typically accuracy and stderr) corresponding to the most typically useful metrics for that scorer.\nYou can override scorer’s built-in metrics by passing an alternate list of metrics to the Task. For example:\nTask(\n    dataset=dataset,\n    solver=[\n        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n        multiple_choice()\n    ],\n    scorer=choice(),\n    metrics=[custom_metric()]\n)\nIf you still want to compute the built-in metrics, we re-specify them along with the custom metrics:\nmetrics=[accuracy(), stderr(), custom_metric()]\n\nBuilt-In Metrics\nInspect includes some simple built in metrics for calculating accuracy, mean, etc. Built in metrics can be imported from the inspect_ai.scorer module. Below is a summary of these metrics. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the Go to Definition command in your source editor.\n\naccuracy()\nCompute proportion of total answers which are correct. For correct/incorrect scores assigned 1 or 0, can optionally assign 0.5 for partially correct answers.\nmean()\nMean of all scores.\nvar()\nSample variance over all scores.\nstd()\nStandard deviation over all scores (see below for details on computing clustered standard errors).\nstderr()\nStandard error of the mean.\nbootstrap_stderr()\nStandard deviation of a bootstrapped estimate of the mean. 1000 samples are taken by default (modify this using the num_samples option).\n\n\n\nMetric Grouping\nThe grouped() function applies a given metric to subgroups of samples defined by a key in sample metadata, creating a separate metric for each group along with an \"all\" metric that aggregates across all samplesor groups. Each sample must have a value for whatever key is used for grouping.\nFor example, let’s say you wanted to create a separate accuracy metric for each distinct “category” variable defined in Sample metadata:\n@task\ndef gpqa():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_gpqa_dataset(\"gpqa_main.csv\"),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n            multiple_choice(),\n        ],\n        scorer=choice(),\n        metrics=[grouped(accuracy(), \"category\"), stderr()]\n    )\nThe metrics passed to the Task override the default metrics of the choice() scorer.\nNote that the \"all\" metric by default takes the selected metric over all of the samples. If you prefer that it take the mean of the individual grouped values, pass all=\"groups\":\ngrouped(accuracy(), \"category\", all=\"groups\")\n\n\nClustered Stderr\nThe stderr() metric supports computing clustered standard errors via the cluster parameter. Most scorers already include stderr() as a built-in metric, so to compute clustered standard errors you’ll want to specify custom metrics for your task (which will override the scorer’s built in metrics).\nFor example, let’s say you wanted to cluster on a “category” variable defined in Sample metadata:\n@task\ndef gpqa():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_gpqa_dataset(\"gpqa_main.csv\"),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n            multiple_choice(),\n        ],\n        scorer=choice(),\n        metrics=[accuracy(), stderr(cluster=\"category\")]\n    )\nThe metrics passed to the Task override the default metrics of the choice() scorer.\n\n\nCustom Metrics\nYou can also add your own metrics with @metric decorated functions. For example, here is the implementation of the mean metric:\nimport numpy as np\n\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import Metric, Score, metric\n\n@metric\ndef mean() -&gt; Metric:\n    \"\"\"Compute mean of all scores.\n\n    Returns:\n       mean metric\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def metric(scores: list[SampleScore]) -&gt; float:\n        return np.mean([score.score.as_float() for score in scores]).item()\n\n    return metric\nNote that the Score class contains a Value that is a union over several scalar and collection types. As a convenience, Score includes a set of accessor methods to treat the value as a simpler form (e.g. above we use the score.as_float() accessor).",

    "text": "Reducing Epochs\nIf a task is run over more than one epoch, multiple scores will be generated for each sample. These scores are then reduced to a single score representing the score for the sample across all the epochs.\nBy default, this is done by taking the mean of all sample scores, but you may specify other strategies for reducing the samples by passing an Epochs, which includes both a count and one or more reducers to combine sample scores with. For example:\n@task\ndef gpqa():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_gpqa_dataset(\"gpqa_main.csv\"),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),\n            multiple_choice(),\n        ],\n        scorer=choice(),\n        epochs=Epochs(5, \"mode\"),\n    )\nYou may also specify more than one reducer which will compute metrics using each of the reducers.

The metadata field will always be reduced to the value of metadata in the first epoch. If your custom metrics function needs differing behavior for reducing fields, you should also implement your own custom reducer and merge or preserve fields in some way.\n\n\n\n\nCustom Reducers\nYou can also add your own reducer with @score_reducer decorated functions.

    "text": "Workflow\n\nUnscored Evals\nBy default, model output in evaluations is automatically scored. However, you can defer scoring by using the --no-score option. For example:\ninspect eval popularity.py --model openai/gpt-4 --no-score\nThis will produce a log with samples that have not yet been scored and with no evaluation metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a distinct scoring step is particularly useful during scorer development, as it bypasses the entire generation phase, saving lots of time and inference costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nScore Command\nYou can score an evaluation previously run this way using the inspect score command:\n# score an unscored eval\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval\nThis will use the scorers and metrics that were declared when the evaluation was run, applying them to score each sample and generate metrics for the evaluation.\nYou may choose to use a different scorer than the task scorer to score a log file. In this case, you can use the --scorer option to pass the name of a scorer (including one in a package) or the path to a source code file containing a scorer to use. For example:\n# use built in match scorer\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer match\n\n# use scorer in a package\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer scorertools/custom_scorer\n\n# use scorer in a file\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer custom_scorer.py\n\n# use a custom scorer named 'classify' in a file with more than one scorer\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer custom_scorers.py@classify\nIf you need to pass arguments to the scorer, you can do do using scorer args (-S) like so:\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer match -S location=end\n\nOverwriting Logs\nWhen you use the inspect score command, you will prompted whether or not you’d like to overwrite the existing log file (with the scores added), or create a new scored log file. By default, the command will create a new log file with a -scored suffix to distinguish it from the original file. You may also control this using the --overwrite flag as follows:\n# overwrite the log with scores from the task defined scorer\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --overwrite\n\n\nOverwriting Scores\nWhen rescoring a previously scored log file you have two options:\n\nAppend Mode (Default): The new scores will be added alongside the existing scores in the log file, keeping both the old and new results.\nOverwrite Mode: The new scores will replace the existing scores in the log file, removing the old results.\n\nYou can choose which mode to use based on whether you want to preserve or discard the previous scoring data. To control this, use the --action arg:\n# append scores from custom scorer\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer custom_scorer.py --action append\n\n# overwrite scores with new scores from custom scorer\ninspect score ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.eval --scorer custom_scorer.py --action overwrite\n\n\n\nScore Function\nYou can also use the score() function in your Python code to score evaluation logs. For example, if you are exploring the performance of different scorers, you might find it more useful to call the score() function using varying scorers or scorer options. For example:\nlog = eval(popularity, model=\"openai/gpt-4\")[0]\n\ngrader_models = [\n    \"openai/gpt-4\",\n    \"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"mistral/mistral-large-latest\"\n]\n\nscoring_logs = [score(log, model_graded_qa(model=model)) \n                for model in grader_models]\n\nplot_results(scoring_logs)\nYou can also use this function to score an existing log file (appending or overwriting results) like so:\n# read the log\ninput_log_path = \"./logs/2025-02-11T15-17-00-05-00_popularity_dPiJifoWeEQBrfWsAopzWr.eval\"\nlog = read_eval_log(input_log_path)\n\ngrader_models = [\n    \"openai/gpt-4\",\n    \"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\",\n    \"google/gemini-2.5-pro\",\n    \"mistral/mistral-large-latest\"\n]\n\n# perform the scoring using various models\nscoring_logs = [score(log, model_graded_qa(model=model), action=\"append\") \n                for model in grader_models]\n\n# write log files with the model name as a suffix\nfor model, scored_log in zip(grader_models, scoring_logs):\n    base, ext = os.path.splitext(input_log_path)\n    output_file = f\"{base}_{model.replace('/', '_')}{ext}\"\n    write_eval_log(scored_log, output_file)",

There are several benefits to using Pydantic models for store access:\n\nYou can provide type annotations and validation rules for all fields.\nDefault values for all fields are declared using standard Pydantic syntax.\nStore names are automatically namespaced (to prevent conflicts between multiple store accessors).\n\n\nDefinition\nFirst, derive a class from StoreModel (which in turn derives from Pydantic BaseModel):\nfrom pydantic import Field\nfrom inspect_ai.util import StoreModel\n\nclass Activity(StoreModel):\n    active: bool = Field(default=False)\n    tries: int = Field(default=0)\n    actions: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\nNote that we define defaults for all fields. This is generally required so that you can initialise your Pydantic model from an empty store. For collections (list and dict) you should use default_factory so that each instance gets its own default.\nThere are two special field names that you cannot use in your StoreModel: the store field is used as a reference to the underlying Store and the optional instance field is used to provide a scope for use of multiple instances of a store model within a sample.\n\n\nUsage\nUse the store_as() function to get a typesafe interface to the store based on your model:\n# typed interface to store from state\nactivity = state.store_as(Activity)\nactivity.active = True\nactivity.tries += 1\n\n# global store_as() function (e.g. for use from tools)\nfrom inspect_ai.util import store_as\nactivity = store_as(Activity)\nNote that all instances of Activity created within a running sample share the same sample Store so can see each other’s changes. For example, you can call state.store_as() in multiple solvers and/or scorers and it will resolve to the same sample-scoped instance.\nThe names used in the underlying Store are namespaced to prevent collisions with other Store accessors. For example, the active field in the Activity class is written to the store with the name Activity:active.\n\n\nNamespaces\nIf you need to create multiple instances of a StoreModel within a sample, you can use the instance parameter to deliniate multiple named instances. For example:\nred_activity = state.store_as(Activity, instance=\"red_team\")\nblue_activity = state.store_as(Activity, instance=\"blue_team\")\n\n\nExplicit Store\nThe store_as() function automatically binds to the current sample Store. You can alternatively create an explicit Store and pass it directly to the model (e.g. for testing purposes):\nfrom inspect_ai.util import Store\nstore = Store()\nactivity = Activity(store=store)",

    "text": "Hello, Inspect\nInspect evaluations have three main components:\n\nDatasets contain a set of labelled samples. Datasets are typically just a table with input and target columns, where input is a prompt and target is either literal value(s) or grading guidance.\nSolvers are chained together to evaluate the input in the dataset and produce a final result. The most elemental solver, generate(), just calls the model with a prompt and collects the output. Other solvers might do prompt engineering, multi-turn dialog, critique, or provide an agent scaffold.\nScorers evaluate the final output of solvers. They may use text comparisons, model grading, or other custom schemes\n\nLet’s take a look at a simple evaluation that aims to see how models perform on the Sally-Anne test, which assesses the ability of a person to infer false beliefs in others. Here are some samples from the dataset:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninput\ntarget\n\n\n\n\nJackson entered the hall. Chloe entered the hall. The boots is in the bathtub. Jackson exited the hall. Jackson entered the dining_room. Chloe moved the boots to the pantry. Where was the boots at the beginning?\nbathtub\n\n\nHannah entered the patio. Noah entered the patio. The sweater is in the bucket. Noah exited the patio. Ethan entered the study. Ethan exited the study. Hannah moved the sweater to the pantry. Where will Hannah look for the sweater?\npantry\n\n\n\nHere’s the code for the evaluation (click on the numbers at right for further explanation):\n\n\ntheory.py\n\nfrom inspect_ai import Task, task\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import example_dataset\nfrom inspect_ai.scorer import model_graded_fact\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import (               \n  chain_of_thought, generate, self_critique   \n)                                             \n\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n1    return Task(\n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n2        solver=[\n          chain_of_thought(),\n          generate(),\n          self_critique()\n        ],\n3        scorer=model_graded_fact()\n    )\n\n\n1\n\nThe Task object brings together the dataset, solvers, and scorer, and is then evaluated using a model.\n\n2\n\nIn this example we are chaining together three standard solver components. It’s also possible to create a more complex custom solver that manages state and interactions internally.\n\n3\n\nSince the output is likely to have pretty involved language, we use a model for scoring.\n\n\nNote that you can provide a single solver or multiple solvers chained together as we did here.\nThe @task decorator applied to the theory_of_mind() function is what enables inspect eval to find and run the eval in the source file passed to it. For example, here we run the eval against GPT-4:\ninspect eval theory.py --model openai/gpt-4",

    "text": "Caching Basics\nUse the cache parameter on calls to generate() to activate the use of the cache. The keys for caching (what determines if a request can be fulfilled from the cache) are as follows:\n\nModel name and base URL (e.g. openai/gpt-4-turbo)\nModel prompt (i.e. message history)\nEpoch number (for ensuring distinct generations per epoch)\nGenerate configuration (e.g. temperature, top_p, etc.)\nActive tools and tool_choice\n\nIf all of these inputs are identical, then the model response will be served from the cache. By default, model responses are cached for 1 week (see Cache Policy below for details on customising this).\nFor example, here we are iterating on our self critique template, so we cache the main call to generate():\n@task\ndef theory_of_mind():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=example_dataset(\"theory_of_mind\"),\n        solver=[\n            chain_of_thought(),\n            generate(cache = True),\n            self_critique(CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE)\n        ]\n        scorer=model_graded_fact(),\n    )\nYou can similarly do this with the generate function passed into a Solver:\n@solver\ndef custom_solver(cache):\n\n  async def solve(state, generate):\n\n    # (custom solver logic prior to generate)\n\n    return generate(state, cache)\n\n  return solve\nYou don’t strictly need to provide a cache argument for a custom solver that uses caching, but it’s generally good practice to enable users of the function to control caching behaviour.\nYou can also use caching with lower-level generate() calls (e.g. a model instance you have obtained with get_model(). For example:\nmodel = get_model(\"anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229\")\noutput = model.generate(input, cache = True)\n\nModel Versions\nThe model name (e.g. openai/gpt-4-turbo) is used as part of the cache key. Note though that many model names are aliases to specific model versions. For example, gpt-4, gpt-4-turbo, may resolve to different versions over time as updates are released.\nIf you want to invalidate caches for updated model versions, it’s much better to use an explicitly versioned model name. For example:\n$ inspect eval ctf.py --model openai/gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\nIf you do this, then when a new version of gpt-4-turbo is deployed a call to the model will occur rather than resolving from the cache.",

For example:\ncache = CachePolicy(expiry = None)\nYou can also define scopes for cache expiration (e.g. cache for a specific task or usage pattern). Use the scopes parameter to add named scopes to the cache key:\ncache = CachePolicy(\n    expiry=\"1M\",\n    scopes={\"role\": \"attacker\", \"team\": \"red\"})\n)\nAs noted above, caching is by default done per epoch (i.e. each epoch has its own cache scope).

    "text": "Provider Caching\nModel providers may also provide prompt caching features to optimise cost and performance for multi-turn conversations. Currently, Inspect includes support for Anthropic Prompt Caching and will extend this support to other providers over time as they add caching to their APIs.\nProvider prompt caching is controlled by the cache-prompt generation config option. The default value for cache-prompt is \"auto\", which enables prompt caching automatically if tool definitions are included in the request. Use true and false to force caching on or off. For example:\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=auto  # enable if tools defined\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=true  # force caching on\ninspect eval ctf.py --cache-prompt=false # force caching off\nOr with the eval() function:\neval(\"ctf.py\", cache_prompt=True)\n\nCache Scope\nProviders will typically provide various means of customising the scope of cache usage. The Inspect cache-prompt option will by default attempt to make maximum use of provider caches (in the Anthropic implementation system messages, tool definitions, and all messages up to the last user message are included in the cache).\nCurrently there is no way to customise the Anthropic cache lifetime (it defaults to 5 minutes)—once this becomes possible this will also be exposed in the Inspect API.\n\n\nUsage Reporting\nWhen using provider caching, model token usage will be reported with 4 distinct values rather than the normal input and output. For example:\n13,684 tokens [I: 22, CW: 1,711, CR: 11,442, O: 509]\nWhere the prefixes on reported token counts stand for:\n\n\n\nI\nInput tokens\n\n\nCW\nInput token cache writes\n\n\nCR\nInput token cache reads\n\n\nO\nOutput tokens\n\n\n\nInput token cache writes will typically cost more (in the case of Anthropic roughly 25% more) but cache reads substantially less (for Anthropic 90% less) so for the example above there would have been a substantial savings in cost and execution time. See the Anthropic Documentation for additional details.",

For example:\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/gpt-4o -M responses_api=true\nNote that certain models including o1-pro and computer_use_preview require the use of the Responses API. Check the Open AI models documentation for details on which models are supported by the respective APIs.\n\n\nResponses Store\nBy default, the Responses API stores requests on the server for retrieval of previous reasoning content (which is not transmitted as part of responses). To control this behavior explicitly use the responses_store model argument. For example:\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/o4-mini -M responses_store=false\nFor example, you might need to do this if you have a non-logging interface to OpenAI models (as store is incompatible with non-logging interfaces). Note that some features (such as computer use) require responses store to be True.\n\n\nFlex Processing\nFlex processing provides significantly lower costs for requests in exchange for slower response times and occasional resource unavailability (input and output tokens are priced using batch API rates for flex requests).\nNote that flex processing is in beta, and currently only available for o3 and o4-mini models.\nTo enable flex processing, use the service_tier model argument, setting it to “flex”. For example:\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/o4-mini -M service_tier=flex\nOpenAI recommends using a higher client timeout when making flex requests (15 minutes rather than the standard 10). Inspect automatically increases the client timeout to 15 minutes (900 seconds) for flex requests. To specify another value, use the client_timeout model argument. For example:\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/o4-mini \\\n    -M service_tier=flex -M client_timeout=1200\n\n\nOpenAI on Azure\nThe openai provider supports OpenAI models deployed on the Azure AI Foundry. To use OpenAI models on Azure AI, specify the following environment variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nAZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY\nAPI key credentials (optional).\n\n\nAZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL\nBase URL for requests (required)\n\n\nAZUREAI_OPENAI_API_VERSION\nOpenAI API version (optional)\n\n\nAZUREAI_AUDIENCE\nAzure resource URI that the access token is intended for when using managed identity (optional, defaults to https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default)\n\n\n\nYou can then use the normal openai provider with the azure qualifier and the name of your model deployment (e.g. gpt-4o-mini). For example:\nexport AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key\nexport AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-url-at.azure.com\nexport AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/azure/gpt-4o-mini\nIf using managed identity for authentication, install the azure-identity package and do not specify AZUREAI_API_KEY.\npip install azure-identity\nexport AZUREAI_OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://your-url-at.azure.com\nexport AZUREAI_AUDIENCE=https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default\nexport AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2025-03-01-preview\ninspect eval math.py --model openai/azure/gpt-4o-mini\nNote that if the AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_VERSION is not specified, Inspect will generally default to the latest deployed version, which as of this writing is 2025-03-01-preview. When using managed identity for authentication, install the azure-identity package and leave AZUREAI_OPENAI_API_KEY undefined.",

Inspect automatically includes the requisite identifier for beta features it utilizes (e.g. “mcp-client-2025-04-04”, “computer-use-2025-01-24”, etc.).\nIf there are other beta features you want to enable, use the betas model arg (-M). For example, to enable 1M token context windows for Sonnet 5 models:\ninspect eval arc.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0 -M betas=context-1m-2025-08-07\n\n\nStreaming\nThe Anthropic provider supports a streaming model arg (-M) that controls whether streaming responses are used. The default (“auto”) will automatically use streaming when thinking is enabled or for potentially long requests (requests with &gt;= 8192 max_tokens). Pass true or false to override the default behavior:\ninspect eval arc.py --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0 -M streaming=true\n\n\nAnthropic on AWS Bedrock\nTo use Anthropic models on Bedrock, use the normal anthropic provider with the bedrock qualifier, specifying a model name that corresponds to a model you have access to on Bedrock. For Bedrock, authentication is not handled using an API key but rather your standard AWS credentials (e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY). You should also be sure to have specified an AWS region. For example:\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key\nexport AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1\ninspect eval arc.py --model anthropic/bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0\nYou can also optionally set the ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL environment variable to set a custom base URL for Bedrock API requests.\n\n\nAnthropic on Vertex AI\nTo use Anthropic models on Vertex, you can use the standard anthropic model provider with the vertex qualifier (e.g. anthropic/vertex/claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022). You should also set two environment variables indicating your project ID and region. Here is a complete example:\nexport ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=project-12345\nexport ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_REGION=us-east5\ninspect eval ctf.py --model anthropic/vertex/claude-3-5-sonnet-v2@20241022\nAuthentication is doing using the standard Google Cloud CLI (i.e. if you have authorised the CLI then no additional auth is needed for the model API).",

The five categories of safety settings are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncivic_integrity\nElection-related queries.\n\n\nsexually_explicit\nContains references to sexual acts or other lewd content.\n\n\nhate_speech\nContent that is rude, disrespectful, or profane.\n\n\nharassment\nNegative or harmful comments targeting identity and/or protected attributes.\n\n\ndangerous_content\nPromotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful acts.\n\n\n\nFor each category, the following block thresholds are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlock Threshold\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnone\nAlways show regardless of probability of unsafe content\n\n\nonly_high\nBlock when high probability of unsafe content\n\n\nmedium_and_above\nBlock when medium or high probability of unsafe content\n\n\nlow_and_above\nBlock when low, medium or high probability of unsafe content\n\n\n\nBy default, Inspect sets all four categories to none (enabling all content). You can override these defaults by using the safety_settings model argument. For example:\nsafety_settings = dict(\n  dangerous_content = \"medium_and_above\",\n  hate_speech = \"low_and_above\"\n)\neval(\n  \"eval.py\",\n  model_args=dict(safety_settings=safety_settings)\n)\nThis also can be done from the command line:\ninspect eval eval.py -M \"safety_settings={'hate_speech': 'low_and_above'}\"",

    "text": "Hugging Face\nThe Hugging Face provider implements support for local models using the transformers package. To use the Hugging Face provider, install the torch, transformers, and accelerate packages and specify a model using the --model option:\npip install torch transformers accelerate\ninspect eval arc.py --model hf/openai-community/gpt2\n\nBatching\nConcurrency for REST API based models is managed using the max_connections option. The same option is used for transformers inference—up to max_connections calls to generate() will be batched together (note that batches will proceed at a smaller size if no new calls to generate() have occurred in the last 2 seconds).\nThe default batch size for Hugging Face is 32, but you should tune your max_connections to maximise performance and ensure that batches don’t exceed available GPU memory. The Pipeline Batching section of the transformers documentation is a helpful guide to the ways batch size and performance interact.\n\n\nDevice\nThe PyTorch cuda device will be used automatically if CUDA is available (as will the Mac OS mps device). If you want to override the device used, use the device model argument. For example:\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model hf/openai-community/gpt2 -M device=cuda:0\nThis also works in calls to eval():\neval(\"arc.py\", model=\"hf/openai-community/gpt2\", model_args=dict(device=\"cuda:0\"))\nOr in a call to get_model()\nmodel = get_model(\"hf/openai-community/gpt2\", device=\"cuda:0\")\n\n\nHidden States\nIf you wish to access hidden states (activations) from generation, use the hidden_states model arg. For example:\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model hf/openai-community/gpt2 -M hidden_states=true\nOr from Python:\nmodel = get_model(\n    model=\"hf/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\",\n    hidden_states=True\n)\nActivations are available in the “hidden_states” field of ModelOutput.metadata. The hidden_states value is the same as transformers GenerateDecoderOnlyOutput.\n\n\nLocal Models\nIn addition to using models from the Hugging Face Hub, the Hugging Face provider can also use local model weights and tokenizers (e.g. for a locally fine tuned model). Use hf/local along with the model_path, and (optionally) tokenizer_path arguments to select a local model. For example, from the command line, use the -M flag to pass the model arguments:\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model hf/local -M model_path=./my-model\nOr using the eval() function:\neval(\"arc.py\", model=\"hf/local\", model_args=dict(model_path=\"./my-model\"))\nOr in a call to get_model()\nmodel = get_model(\"hf/local\", model_path=\"./my-model\")",

However, you can still use the max_connections option to control the number of concurrent requests which defaults to 32.\n\n\nDevice\nThe device option is also available for vLLM models, and you can use it to specify the device(s) to run the model on. For example:\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model vllm/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct -M device='0,1,2,3'\n\n\nLocal Models\nSimilar to the Hugging Face provider, you can also use local models with the vLLM provider.

For example, from the command line, use the -M flag to pass the model arguments:\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model vllm/local -M model_path=./my-model\n\n\nTool Use and Reasoning\nvLLM supports tool use and reasoning; however, the usage is often model dependant and requires additional configuration. See the Tool Use and Reasoning sections of the vLLM documentation for details.\n\n\nvLLM Server\nRather than letting Inspect start and stop a vLLM server every time you run an evaluation (which can take several minutes for large models), you can instead start the server manually and then connect to it. To do this, set the model base URL to point to the vLLM server and the API key to the server’s API key. For example:\n$ export VLLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1\n$ export VLLM_API_KEY=&lt;your-server-api-key&gt;\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model vllm/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct\nor\n$ inspect eval arc.py --model vllm/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct --model-base-url http://localhost:8080/v1 -M api_key=&lt;your-server-api-key&gt;\nSee the vLLM documentation on Server Mode for additional details.",

    "section": "Tool Errors",
    "text": "Tool Errors\nVarious errors can occur during tool execution, especially when interacting with the file system or network or when using Sandbox Environments to execute code in a container sandbox. As a tool writer you need to decide how you’d like to handle error conditions. A number of approaches are possible:\n\nNotify the model that an error occurred to see whether it can recover.\nCatch and handle the error internally (trying another code path, etc.).\nAllow the error to propagate, resulting in the current Sample failing with an error state.\n\nThere are no universally correct approaches as tool usage and semantics can vary widely—some rough guidelines are provided below.\n\nDefault Handling\nIf you do not explicitly handle errors, then Inspect provides some default error handling behaviour. Specifically, if any of the following errors are raised they will be handled and reported to the model:\n\nTimeoutError — Occurs when a call to subprocess() or sandbox().exec() times out.\nPermissionError — Occurs when there are inadequate permissions to read or write a file.\nUnicodeDecodeError — Occurs when the output from executing a process or reading a file is binary rather than text.\nOutputLimitExceededError - Occurs when one or both of the output streams from sandbox().exec() exceed 10 MiB or when attempting to read a file over 100 MiB in size.\nToolError — Special error thrown by tools to indicate they’d like to report an error to the model.\n\nThese are all errors that are expected (in fact the SandboxEnvironment interface documents them as such) and possibly recoverable by the model (try a different command, read a different file, etc.). Unexpected errors (e.g. a network error communicating with a remote service or container runtime) on the other hand are not automatically handled and result in the Sample failing with an error.\nMany tools can simply rely on the default handling to provide reasonable behaviour around both expected and unexpected errors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we say that the errors are reported directly to the model, this refers to the behaviour when using the default generate(). If on the other hand, you are have created custom scaffolding for an agent, you can intercept tool errors and apply additional filtering and logic.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Handling\nIn some cases a tool can implement a recovery strategy for error conditions. For example, an HTTP request might fail due to transient network issues, and retrying the request (perhaps after a delay) may resolve the problem. Explicit error handling strategies are generally applied when there are expected errors that are not already handled by Inspect’s Default Handling.\nAnother type of explicit handling is re-raising an error to bypass Inspect’s default handling. For example, here we catch at re-raise TimeoutError so that it fails the Sample:\ntry:\n  result = await sandbox().exec(\n    cmd=[\"decode\", file], \n    timeout=timeout\n  )\nexcept TimeoutError:\n  raise RuntimeError(\"Decode operation timed out.\")",

This is equivalent to specifying newline=\"\" in a call to the Python open() function. Note that write_file() automatically creates parent directories as required if they don’t exist.\nThe connection() method is optional, and provides commands that can be used to login to the sandbox container from a terminal or IDE.\nNote that to deal with potential unreliability of container services, the exec() method includes a timeout_retry parameter that defaults to True. For sandbox implementations this parameter is advisory (they should only use it if potential unreliability exists in their runtime). No more than 2 retries should be attempted and both with timeouts less than 60 seconds. If you are executing commands that are not idempotent (i.e. the side effects of a failed first attempt may affect the results of subsequent attempts) then you can specify timeout_retry=False to override this behavior.\nFor each method there is a documented set of errors that are raised: these are expected errors and can either be caught by tools or allowed to propagate in which case they will be reported to the model for potential recovery. In addition, unexpected errors may occur (e.g. a networking error connecting to a remote container): these errors are not reported to the model and fail the Sample with an error state.\nSee the documentation on Sandbox Environments for additional details.",

You also might have need to do this during development of tools (to explore what descriptions are most useful to models).\nThe tool_with() function enables you to take any tool and adapt its name and/or descriptions. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import tool_with\n\nmy_add = tool_with(\n  tool=addition(), \n  name=\"my_add\",\n  description=\"a tool to add numbers\", \n  parameters={\n    \"x\": \"the x argument\",\n    \"y\": \"the y argument\"\n  })\nYou need not provide all of the parameters shown above, for example here are some examples where we modify just the main tool description or only a single parameter:\nmy_add1 = tool_with(addition(), description=\"a tool to add numbers\")\nmy_add2 = tool_with(addition(), parameters={\"x\": \"the x argument\"})\nNote that tool_with() function modifies the passed tool in-place, so if you want to create multiple variations of a single tool using tool_with() you should create the underlying tool multiple times, once for each call to tool_with() (this is demonsrated in the example above).",

    "text": "Dynamic Tools\nAs described above, normally tools are defined using @tool decorators and documentation comments. It’s also possible to create a tool dynamically from any function by creating a ToolDef. For example:\nfrom inspect_ai.solver import use_tools\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import ToolDef\n\nasync def addition(x: int, y: int):\n    return x + y\n\nadd = ToolDef(\n    tool=addition,\n    name=\"add\",\n    description=\"A tool to add numbers\", \n    parameters={\n        \"x\": \"the x argument\",\n        \"y\": \"the y argument\"\n    })\n)\n\nuse_tools([add])\nThis is effectively what happens under the hood when you use the @tool decorator. There is one critical requirement for functions that are bound to tools using ToolDef: type annotations must be provided in the function signature (e.g. x: int, y: int).\nFor Inspect APIs, ToolDef can generally be used anywhere that Tool can be used (use_tools(), setting state.tools, etc.). If you are using a 3rd party API that does not take Tool in its interface, use the ToolDef.as_tool() method to adapt it. For example:\nfrom inspect_agents import my_agent\nagent = my_agent(tools=[add.as_tool()])\nIf on the other hand you want to get the ToolDef for an existing tool (e.g. to discover its name, description, and parameters) you can just pass the Tool to the ToolDef constructor (including whatever overrides for name, etc. you want):\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import ToolDef, bash\nbash_def = ToolDef(bash())",

    "text": "Model APIs\nYou can add a model provider by deriving a new class from ModelAPI and then creating a function decorated by @modelapi that returns the class. These are typically implemented in separate files (for reasons described below):\n\n\ncustom.py\n\nclass CustomModelAPI(ModelAPI):\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        model_name: str,\n        base_url: str | None = None,\n        api_key: str | None = None,\n        api_key_vars: list[str] = [],\n        config: GenerateConfig = GenerateConfig(),\n        **model_args: Any\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        super().__init__(model_name, base_url, api_key, api_key_vars, config)\n\n    async def generate(\n        self,\n        input: list[ChatMessage],\n        tools: list[ToolInfo],\n        tool_choice: ToolChoice,\n        config: GenerateConfig,\n    ) -&gt; ModelOutput:\n        ...\n\n\n\nproviders.py\n\n@modelapi(name=\"custom\")\ndef custom():\n    from .custom import CustomModelAPI\n\n    return CustomModelAPI\n\nThe layer of indirection (creating a function that returns a ModelAPI class) is done so that you can separate the registration of models from the importing of libraries they require (important for limiting dependencies). You can see this used within Inspect to make all model package dependencies optional here. With this scheme, packages required to interact with models (e.g. openai, anthropic, vllm, etc.) are only imported when their model API type is actually used.\nThe __init__() method must call the super().__init__() method, and typically instantiates the model client library.\nThe __init__() method receive a **model_args parameter that will carry any custom model_args (or -M and --model-config arguments from the CLI) specified by the user. You can then pass these on to the appropriate place in your model initialisation code (for example, here is what many of the built-in providers do with model_args passed to them: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/models.html#model-args).\nThe generate() method handles interacting with the model, converting inspect messages, tools, and config into model native data structures. Note that the generate method may optionally return a tuple[ModelOutput,ModelCall] in order to record the raw request and response to the model within the sample transcript.\nIn addition, there are some optional properties you can override to specify various behaviours and constraints (default max tokens and connections, identifying rate limit errors, whether to collapse consecutive user and/or assistant messages, etc.). See the ModelAPI source code for further documentation on these properties.\nSee the implementation of the built-in model providers for additional insight on building a custom provider.\n\nModel Registration\nIf you are publishing a custom model API within a Python package, you should register an inspect_ai setuptools entry point. This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a model name that uses your provider.\nFor example, if your package was named evaltools and your model provider was exported from a source file named _registry.py at the root of your package, you would register it like this in pyproject.toml:\n\nSetuptoolsuvPoetry\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n\n\n\nModel Usage\nOnce you’ve created the class, decorated it with @modelapi as shown above, and registered it, then you can use it as follows:\ninspect eval ctf.py --model custom/my-model\nWhere my-model is the name of some model supported by your provider (this will be passed to __init()__ in the model_name argument).\nYou can also reference it from within Python calls to get_model() or eval():\n# get a model instance\nmodel = get_model(\"custom/my-model\")\n\n# run an eval with the model\neval(math, model = \"custom/my-model\")",

Return None for no limit (the default behaviour). |\n| default_polling_interval() | Called when sandbox services are created to determine the default polling interval (in seconds) for request checking. Defaultss to 2 seconds. | |\nIn the case of parallel execution of a group of tasks within the same working directory, the task_init() and task_cleanup() functions will be called once for each unique sandbox environment configuration (e.g. Docker Compose file). This is a performance optimisation derived from the fact that initialisation and cleanup are shared for tasks with identical configurations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “default” SandboxEnvironment i.e. that named “default” or marked as default in some other provider-specific way, must be the first key/value in the dictionary returned from sample_init().\n\n\n\nThe task_cleanup() has a number of important functions:\n\nThere may be global resources that are not tied to samples that need to be cleaned up.\nIt’s possible that sample_cleanup() will be interrupted (e.g. via a Ctrl+C) during execution. In that case its resources are still not cleaned up.\nThe sample_cleanup() function might be long running, and in the case of error or interruption you want to provide explicit user feedback on the cleanup in the console (which isn’t possible when cleanup is run “inline” with samples). An interrupted flag is passed to sample_cleanup() which allows for varying behaviour for this scenario.\nCleanup may be disabled (e.g. when the user passes --no-sandbox-cleanup) in which case it should print container IDs and instructions for cleaning up after the containers are no longer needed.\n\nTo implement task_cleanup() properly, you’ll likely need to track running environments using a per-coroutine ContextVar. The DockerSandboxEnvironment provides an example of this. Note that the cleanup argument passed to task_cleanup() indicates whether to actually clean up (it would be False if --no-sandbox-cleanup was passed to inspect eval). In this case you might want to print a list of the resources that were not cleaned up and provide directions on how to clean them up manually.\nThe cli_cleanup() function is a global cleanup handler that should be able to do the following:\n\nCleanup all environments created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. inspect sandbox cleanup docker at the CLI).\nCleanup a single environment created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. inspect sandbox cleanup docker &lt;id&gt; at the CLI).\n\nThe task_cleanup() function will typically print out the information required to invoke cli_cleanup() when it is invoked with cleanup = False. Try invoking the DockerSandboxEnvironment with --no-sandbox-cleanup to see an example.\nThe SandboxEnvironment instance methods provide access to process execution and file input/output within the environment.\nclass SandboxEnvironment:\n   \n    async def exec(\n        self,\n        cmd: list[str],\n        input: str | bytes | None = None,\n        cwd: str | None = None,\n        env: dict[str, str] = {},\n        user: str | None = None,\n        timeout: int | None = None,\n        timeout_retry: bool = True,\n        concurrency: bool = True\n    ) -&gt; ExecResult[str]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          TimeoutError: If the specified `timeout` expires.\n          UnicodeDecodeError: If an error occurs while\n            decoding the command output.\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to execute the command.\n          OutputLimitExceededError: If an output stream\n            exceeds the 10 MiB limit.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    async def write_file(\n        self, file: str, contents: str | bytes\n    ) -&gt; None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to write to the specified path.\n          IsADirectoryError: If the file exists already and \n            is a directory.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    async def read_file(\n        self, file: str, text: bool = True\n    ) -&gt; Union[str | bytes]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n          FileNotFoundError: If the file does not exist.\n          UnicodeDecodeError: If an encoding error occurs \n            while reading the file.\n            (only applicable when `text = True`)\n          PermissionError: If the user does not have\n            permission to read from the specified path.\n          IsADirectoryError: If the file is a directory.\n          OutputLimitExceededError: If the file size\n            exceeds the 100 MiB limit.\n        \"\"\"\n        ...\n\n    async def connection(self, *, user: str | None = None) -&gt; SandboxConnection:\n        \"\"\"\n        Raises:\n           NotImplementedError: For sandboxes that don't provide connections\n           ConnectionError: If sandbox is not currently running.\n        \"\"\"\nThe read_file() method should preserve newline constructs (e.g. crlf should be preserved not converted to lf). This is equivalent to specifying newline=\"\" in a call to the Python open() function. Note that write_file() automatically creates parent directories as required if they don’t exist.\nThe connection() method is optional, and provides commands that can be used to login to the sandbox container from a terminal or IDE.\nNote that to deal with potential unreliability of container services, the exec() method includes a timeout_retry parameter that defaults to True. For sandbox implementations this parameter is advisory (they should only use it if potential unreliability exists in their runtime). No more than 2 retries should be attempted and both with timeouts less than 60 seconds. If you are executing commands that are not idempotent (i.e. the side effects of a failed first attempt may affect the results of subsequent attempts) then you can specify timeout_retry=False to override this behavior.\nFor each method there is a documented set of errors that are raised: these are expected errors and can either be caught by tools or allowed to propagate in which case they will be reported to the model for potential recovery. In addition, unexpected errors may occur (e.g. a networking error connecting to a remote container): these errors are not reported to the model and fail the Sample with an error state.\nThe best way to learn about writing sandbox environments is to look at the source code for the built in environments, LocalSandboxEnvironment and DockerSandboxEnvironment.\n\nEnvironment Registration\nYou should build your custom sandbox environment within a Python package, and then register an inspect_ai setuptools entry point. This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a sandbox environment that uses your provider.\nFor example, if your package was named evaltools and your sandbox environment provider was exported from a source file named _registry.py at the root of your package, you would register it like this in pyproject.toml:\n\nSetuptoolsuvPoetry\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]\nevaltools = \"evaltools._registry\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Usage\nOnce the package is installed, you can refer to the custom sandbox environment the same way you’d refer to a built in sandbox environment. For example:\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=\"podman\"\n)\nSandbox environments can be invoked with an optional configuration parameter, which is passed as the config argument to the startup() and setup() methods. In Python this is done with a tuple\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=(\"podman\",\"config.yaml\")\n)\nSpecialised configuration types which derive from Pydantic’s BaseModel can also be passed as the config argument to SandboxEnvironmentSpec. Note: they must be hashable (i.e. frozen=True).\nclass PodmanSandboxEnvironmentConfig(BaseModel, frozen=True):\n    socket: str\n    runtime: str\n\nTask(\n    ...,\n    sandbox=SandboxEnvironmentSpec(\n        \"podman\",\n        PodmanSandboxEnvironmentConfig(socket=\"/podman-socket\", runtime=\"crun\"),\n    )\n)",

Inspect uses the fsspec package to read and write files, which provides support for a wide variety of filesystems, including:\n\nAmazon S3\nGoogle Cloud Storage\nAzure Blob Storage\nAzure Data Lake Storage\nDVC\n\nSupport for Amazon S3 is built in to Inspect via the s3fs package. Other filesystems may require installation of additional packages. See the list of built in filesystems and other known implementations for all supported storage back ends.\nSee Custom Filesystems below for details on implementing your own fsspec compatible filesystem as a storage back-end.\n\n\nFilesystem Functions\nThe following Inspect API functions use fsspec:\n\nresource() for reading prompt templates and other supporting files.\ncsv_dataset() and json_dataset() for reading datasets (note that files referenced within samples can also use fsspec filesystem references).\nlist_eval_logs() , read_eval_log(), write_eval_log(), and retryable_eval_logs().\n\nFor example, to use S3 you would prefix your paths with s3://:\n# read a prompt template from s3\nprompt_template(\"s3://inspect-prompts/ctf.txt\")\n\n# read a dataset from S3\ncsv_dataset(\"s3://inspect-datasets/ctf-12.csv\")\n\n# read eval logs from S3\nlist_eval_logs(\"s3://my-s3-inspect-log-bucket\")\n\n\nCustom Filesystems\nSee the fsspec developer documentation for details on implementing a custom filesystem.

You can control this by implementing an enabled() method on your hook. For example:\n@hooks(name=\"w&b_hooks\", description=\"Weights & Biases integration\")\nclass WBHooks(Hooks):\n    def enabled():\n        return \"WANDB_API_KEY\" in os.environ\n    ...\n\n\nRequiring Hooks\nAnother thing you might want to do is ensure that all users in a given environment are running with a particular set of hooks enabled.

Sometimes though its preferable to explicitly orchestrate agent operations. For example, many deep research agents are implemented with explicit steps for planning, search, and writing.\nYou can use the run() function to explicitly invoke agents using a predefined or dynamic sequence. For example, imagine we have written agents for various stages of a research pipeline. We can compose them into a research agent as follows:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import Agent, AgentState, agent, run\nfrom inspect_ai.model import ChatMessageSystem\n\nfrom research_pipeline import (\n    research_planner, research_searcher, research_writer\n)\n\n@agent\ndef researcher() -&gt; Agent:\n\n    async def execute(state: AgentState) -&gt; AgentState:\n        \"\"\"Research assistant.\"\"\"\n        \n        state.messages.append(\n            ChatMessageSystem(\"You are an expert researcher.\")\n        )\n        \n        state = run(research_planner(), state)\n        state = run(research_searcher(), state)\n        state = run(research_writer(), state)\n\n        return state\nIn a workflow you might not always pass and assign the entire state to each operation as shown above. Rather, you might make a more narrow query and use the results to determine the next step(s) in the workflow. Further, you might choose to execute some steps in parallel. For example:\nfrom asyncio import gather\n\nplans = await gather(\n    run(web_search_planner(), state),\n    run(experiment_planner(), state)\n)\nNote that the run() method makes a copy of the input so is suitable for running in parallel as shown above (the two parallel runs will not make shared/conflicting edits to the state).",

    "text": "Handoffs\nHandoffs enable a supervisor agent to delegate to other agents. Handoffs are distinct from tool calls because they enable the handed-off to agent both visibility into the conversation history and the ability to append messages to it.\nHandoffs are automatically presented to the model as tool calls with a transfer_to prefix (e.g. transfer_to_web_surfer) and the model is prompted to understand that it is in a multi-agent system where other agents can be delegated to.\nCreate handoffs by enclosing an agent with the handoff() function. These agents in turn are often simple react() agents with a tailored prompt and set of tools. For example, here we create a web_surfer() agent that we can handoff to:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent react\nfrom inspect_ai.tool import web_browser\n\nweb_surfer = react(\n    name=\"web_surfer\",\n    description=\"Web research assistant\",\n    prompt=\"You are a tenacious web researcher that is expert \"\n           + \"at using a web browser to answer questions.\",\n    tools=web_browser()   \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we call the react() function to create the web_surfer agent we pass name and description parameters. These parameters are required when you are using a react agent in a handoff (so the supervisor model knows its name and capabilities).\n\n\n\nWe can then create a supervisor agent that has access to both a standard tool and the ability to hand off to the web surfer agent. In this case the supervisor is a standard react() agent however other approaches to supervision are possible.\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import handoff\nfrom inspect_ai.dataset import Sample\nfrom math_tools import addition\n\nsupervisor = react(\n    prompt=\"You are an agent that can answer addition \" \n            + \"problems and do web research.\",\n    tools=[addition(), handoff(web_surfer)]\n)\n\ntask = Task(\n    dataset=[\n        Sample(input=\"Please add 1+1 then tell me what \" \n                     + \"movies were popular in 2020\")\n    ],\n    solver=supervisor,\n    sandbox=\"docker\",\n)\nThe supervisor agent has access to both a conventional addition() tool as well as the ability to handoff() to the web_surfer agent. The web surfer in turn has its own react loop, and because it was handed off to, has access to both the full message history and can append its own messages to the history.\n\nHandoff Filters\nBy default when a handoff occurs:\n\nThe target agent sees the global message history (except for system messages).\nThe messages generated by the handoff are processed using the content_only() filter, which removes system messages and reasoning traces as well as converts tool calls to text (this is so that the parent model is not confounded by seeing content, e.g. reasoning or tool calls, that it doesn’t understand the origin of.\n\nYou can do custom filtering by passing another built-in handoff filter or writing your own filter. For example, you can use the built-in remove_tools input filter to remove all tool calls from the history in the messages presented to the agent (this is sometimes necessary so that agents don’t get confused about what tools are available):\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import remove_tools\n\nhandoff(web_surfer, input_filter=remove_tools)\nYou can also use the built-in last_message output filter to only append the last message of the agent’s history to the global conversation:\nfrom inspect_ai.agent import last_message\n\nhandoff(web_surfer, output_filter=last_message)\nYou aren’t confined to the built in filters—you can pass a function as either the input_filter or output_filter, for example:\nasync def my_filter(messages: list[ChatMessage]) -&gt; list[ChatMessage]:\n    # filter messages however you need to...\n    return messages\n\nhandoff(web_surfer, output_filter=my_filter)",

Typically 1/8 the size of .json files and accesses samples incrementally, yielding fast loading in Inspect View no matter the file size.\n\n\n.json\nText file format with native JSON representation. Occupies substantially more disk space and can be slow to load in Inspect View if larger than 50MB.\n\n\n\nBoth formats are fully supported by the Log File API and Log Commands described below, and can be intermixed freely within a log directory.\n\nFormat Option\nBeginning with Inspect v0.3.46, .eval is the default log file format. You can explicitly control the global log format default in your .env file:\n\n\n.env\n\nINSPECT_LOG_FORMAT=eval\n\nOr specify it per-evaluation with the --log-format option:\ninspect eval ctf.py --log-format=eval\nNo matter which format you choose, the EvalLog returned from eval() will be the same, and the various APIs provided for log files (read_eval_log(), write_eval_log(), etc.) will also work the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe variability in underlying file format makes it especially important that you use the Python Log File API for reading and writing log files (as opposed to reading/writing JSON directly).\nIf you do need to interact with the underlying JSON (e.g., when reading logs from another language) see the Log Commands section below which describes how to get the plain text JSON representation for any log file.",

This enables you to modify the contents of a log file return from eval() as follows:\nlog = eval(my_task())[0]\n# edit EvalLog as required\nwrite_eval_log(log)\nOr alternatively for an EvalLog read from a filesystem:\nlog = read_eval_log(log_file_path)\n# edit EvalLog as required\nwrite_eval_log(log)\nIf you are working with the results of an Eval Set, the returned logs are headers rather than the full log with all samples. If you want to edit logs returned from eval_set you should read them fully, edit them, and then write them. For example:\nsuccess, logs = eval_set(tasks)\n \nfor log in logs:\n    log = read_eval_log(log.location)\n    # edit EvalLog as required\n    write_eval_log(log)\nNote that the EvalLog.location is a URI rather than a traditional file path(e.g. it could be a file:// URI, an s3:// URI or any other URI supported by fsspec).\n\n\nFunctions\nYou can enumerate, read, and write EvalLog objects using the following helper functions from the inspect_ai.log module:\n\n\n\nFunction\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nlist_eval_logs\nList all of the eval logs at a given location.\n\n\nread_eval_log\nRead an EvalLog from a log file path (pass header_only to not read samples).\n\n\nread_eval_log_sample\nRead a single EvalSample from a log file\n\n\nread_eval_log_samples\nRead all samples incrementally (returns a generator that yields samples one at a time).\n\n\nread_eval_log_sample_summaries\nRead a summary of all samples (including scoring for each sample).\n\n\nwrite_eval_log\nWrite an EvalLog to a log file path (pass if_match_etag for S3 conditional writes).\n\n\n\nA common workflow is to define an INSPECT_LOG_DIR for running a set of evaluations, then calling list_eval_logs() to analyse the results when all the work is done:\n# setup log dir context\nos.environ[\"INSPECT_LOG_DIR\"] = \"./experiment-logs\"\n\n# do a bunch of evals\neval(popularity, model=\"openai/gpt-4\")\neval(security_guide, model=\"openai/gpt-4\")\n\n# analyze the results in the logs\nlogs = list_eval_logs()\nNote that list_eval_logs() lists log files recursively. Pass recursive=False to list only the log files at the root level.\n\n\nLog Headers\nEval log files can get quite large (multiple GB) so it is often useful to read only the header, which contains metadata and aggregated scores. Use the header_only option to read only the header of a log file:\nlog_header = read_eval_log(log_file, header_only=True)\nThe log header is a standard EvalLog object without the samples fields. The reductions field is included for eval log files and not for json log files.\n\n\nSummaries\nIt may also be useful to read only the summary level information about samples (input, target, error status, and scoring). To do this, use the read_eval_log_sample_summaries() function:\nsummaries = read_eval_log_sample_summaries(log_file)\nThe summaries are a list of EvalSampleSummary objects, one for each sample. Some sample data is “thinned” in the interest of keeping the summaries small: images are removed from input, metadata is restricted to scalar values (with strings truncated to 1k), and scores include only their value.\nReading only sample summaries will take orders of magnitude less time than reading all of the samples one-by-one, so if you only need access to summary level data, always prefer this function to reading the entire log file.\n\nFiltering\nYou can also use read_eval_log_sample_summaries() as means of filtering which samples you want to read in full. For example, imagine you only want to read samples that include errors:\nerrors: list[EvalSample] = []\nfor sample in read_eval_log_sample_summaries(log_file):\n    if sample.error is not None\n        errors.append(\n            read_eval_log_sample(log_file, sample.id, sample.epoch)\n        )\n\n\n\nStreaming\nIf you are working with log files that are too large to comfortably fit in memory, we recommend the following options and workflow to stream them rather than loading them into memory all at once :\n\nUse the .eval log file format which supports compression and incremental access to samples (see details on this in the Log Format section above). If you have existing .json files you can easily batch convert them to .eval using the Log Commands described below.\nIf you only need access to the “header” of the log file (which includes general eval metadata as well as the evaluation results) use the header_only option of read_eval_log():\nlog = read_eval_log(log_file, header_only = True)\nIf you want to read individual samples, either read them selectively using read_eval_log_sample(), or read them iteratively using read_eval_log_samples() (which will ensure that only one sample at a time is read into memory):\n# read a single sample\nsample = read_eval_log_sample(log_file, id = 42)\n\n# read all samples using a generator\nfor sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file):\n    ...\n\nNote that read_eval_log_samples() will raise an error if you pass it a log that does not have status==\"success\" (this is because it can’t read all of the samples in an incomplete log). If you want to read the samples anyway, pass the all_samples_required=False option:\n# will not raise an error if the log file has an \"error\" or \"cancelled\" status\nfor sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file, all_samples_required=False):\n    ...\n\n\nAttachments\nSample logs often include large pieces of content that are duplicated in multiple places in the log file (input, message history, events, etc.). To keep the size of log files manageable, images and other large blocks of content are de-duplicated and stored as attachments.\nWhen reading log files, you may want to resolve the attachments so you can get access to the underlying content. You can do this for an EvalSample using the resolve_sample_attachments() function:\nfrom inspect_ai.log import resolve_sample_attachments\n\nsample = resolve_sample_attachments(sample)\nNote that the read_eval_log() and read_eval_log_sample() functions also take a resolve_attachments option if you want to resolve at the time of reading.\nNote you will most typically not want to resolve attachments. The two cases that require attachment resolution for an EvalSample are:\n\nYou want access to the base64 encoded images within the input and messages fields; or\nYou are directly reading the events transcript, and want access to the underlying content (note that more than just images are de-duplicated in events, so anytime you are reading it you will likely want to resolve attachments).",

    "section": "Eval Retries",
    "text": "Eval Retries\nWhen an evaluation task fails due to an error or is otherwise interrupted (e.g. by a Ctrl+C), an evaluation log is still written. In many cases errors are transient (e.g. due to network connectivity or a rate limit) and can be subsequently retried.\nFor these cases, Inspect includes an eval-retry command and eval_retry() function that you can use to resume tasks interrupted by errors (including preserving samples already completed within the original task). For example, if you had a failing task with log file logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_Gprr29Mv.json, you could retry it from the shell with:\n$ inspect eval-retry logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\nOr from Python with:\neval_retry(\"logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\")\nNote that retry only works for tasks that are created from @task decorated functions (as if a Task is created dynamically outside of an @task function Inspect does not know how to reconstruct it for the retry).\nNote also that eval_retry() does not overwrite the previous log file, but rather creates a new one (preserving the task_id from the original file).\nHere’s an example of retrying a failed eval with a lower number of max_connections (the theory being that too many concurrent connections may have caused a rate limit error):\nlog = eval(my_task)[0]\nif log.status != \"success\":\n  eval_retry(log, max_connections = 3)\n\nSample Preservation\nWhen retrying a log file, Inspect will attempt to re-use completed samples from the original task. This can result in substantial time and cost savings compared to starting over from the beginning.\n\nIDs and Shuffling\nAn important constraint on the ability to re-use completed samples is matching them up correctly with samples in the new task. To do this, Inspect requires stable unique identifiers for each sample. This can be achieved in 1 of 2 ways:\n\nSamples can have an explicit id field which contains the unique identifier; or\nYou can rely on Inspect’s assignment of an auto-incrementing id for samples, however this will not work correctly if your dataset is shuffled. Inspect will log a warning and not re-use samples if it detects that the dataset.shuffle() method was called, however if you are shuffling by some other means this automatic safeguard won’t be applied.\n\nIf dataset shuffling is important to your evaluation and you want to preserve samples for retried tasks, then you should include an explicit id field in your dataset.\n\n\nMax Samples\nAnother consideration is max_samples, which is the maximum number of samples to run concurrently within a task. Larger numbers of concurrent samples will result in higher throughput, but will also result in completed samples being written less frequently to the log file, and consequently less total recovable samples in the case of an interrupted task.\nBy default, Inspect sets the value of max_samples to max_connections + 1 (note that it would rarely make sense to set it lower than max_connections). The default max_connections is 10, which will typically result in samples being written to the log frequently. On the other hand, setting a very large max_connections (e.g. 100 max_connections for a dataset with 100 samples) may result in very few recoverable samples in the case of an interruption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your task involves tool calls and/or sandboxes, then you will likely want to set max_samples to greater than max_connections, as your samples will sometimes be calling the model (using up concurrent connections) and sometimes be executing code in the sandbox (using up concurrent subprocess calls). While running tasks you can see the utilization of connections and subprocesses in realtime and tune your max_samples accordingly.\n\n\n\nWe’ve discussed how to manage retries for a single evaluation run interactively. For the case of running many evaluation tasks in batch and retrying those which failed, see the documentation on Eval Sets",

    "text": "Log Commands\nWe’ve shown a number of Python functions that let you work with eval logs from code. However, you may be writing an orchestration or visualisation tool in another language (e.g. TypeScript) where its not particularly convenient to call the Python API. The Inspect CLI has a few commands intended to make it easier to work with Inspect logs from other languages:\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninspect log list\nList all logs in the log directory.\n\n\ninspect log dump\nPrint log file contents as JSON.\n\n\ninspect log convert\nConvert between log file formats.\n\n\ninspect log schema\nPrint JSON schema for log files.\n\n\n\n\nListing Logs\nYou can use the inspect log list command to enumerate all of the logs for a given log directory. This command will utilise the INSPECT_LOG_DIR if it is set (alternatively you can specify a --log-dir directly). You’ll likely also want to use the --json flag to get more granular and structured information on the log files. For example:\n$ inspect log list --json           # uses INSPECT_LOG_DIR\n$ inspect log list --json --log-dir ./security_04-07-2024\nYou can also use the --status option to list only logs with a success or error status:\n$ inspect log list --json --status success\n$ inspect log list --json --status error\nYou can use the --retryable option to list only logs that are retryable\n$ inspect log list --json --retryable\n\n\nReading Logs\nThe inspect log list command will return set of URIs to log files which will use a variety of protocols (e.g. file://, s3://, gcs://, etc.). You might be tempted to try to read these URIs directly, however you should always do so using the inspect log dump command for two reasons:\n\nAs described above in Log Format, log files may be stored in binary or text. the inspect log dump command will print any log file as plain text JSON no matter its underlying format.\nLog files can be located on remote storage systems (e.g. Amazon S3) that users have configured read/write credentials for within their Inspect environment, and you’ll want to be sure to take advantage of these credentials.\n\nFor example, here we read a local log file and a log file on Amazon S3:\n$ inspect log dump file:///home/user/log/logfile.json\n$ inspect log dump s3://my-evals-bucket/logfile.json\n\n\nConverting Logs\nYou can convert between the two underlying log formats using the inspect log convert command. The convert command takes a source path (with either a log file or a directory of log files) along with two required arguments that specify the conversion (--to and --output-dir). For example:\n$ inspect log convert source.json --to eval --output-dir log-output\nOr for an entire directory:\n$ inspect log convert logs --to eval --output-dir logs-eval\nLogs that are already in the target format are simply copied to the output directory. By default, log files in the target directory will not be overwritten, however you can add the --overwrite flag to force an overwrite.\nNote that the output directory is always required to enforce the practice of not doing conversions that result in side-by-side log files that are identical save for their format.\n\n\nLog Schema\nLog files are stored in JSON. You can get the JSON schema for the log file format with a call to inspect log schema:\n$ inspect log schema\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaN and Inf\n\n\n\nBecause evaluation logs contain lots of numerical data and calculations, it is possible that some number values will be NaN or Inf. These numeric values are supported natively by Python’s JSON parser, however are not supported by the JSON parsers built in to browsers and Node JS.\nTo correctly read Nan and Inf values from eval logs in JavaScript, we recommend that you use the JSON5 Parser. For other languages, Nan and Inf may be natively supported (if not, see these JSON 5 implementations for other languages).",

If you have already cancelled an evaluation you’ll see a list of cancelled actions (with the most recently completed cancelled action on top) which will often also tell you which cancelled action was keeping an evaluation from completing.\nPassing no arguments shows the most recent trace log, pass a log file name to view another log:\ninspect trace anomalies trace-86396.log.gz\n\nErrors and Timeouts\nBy default, the inspect trace anomalies command prints only currently running or cancelled actions (as these are what is required to diagnose an evaluation that doesn’t complete). You can optionally also display actions that ended with errors or timeouts by passing the --all flag:\ninspect trace anomalies --all\nNote that errors and timeouts are not by themselves evidence of problems, since both occur in the normal course of running evaluations (e.g. model generate calls can return errors that are retried and Docker or S3 can also return retryable errors or timeout when they are under heavy load).\nAs with the inspect trace dump command, you can apply a filter when listing anomalies. For example:\ninspect trace anomalies --filter model",

    "text": "Tracing API\nIn addition to the standard set of actions which are trace logged, you can do your own custom trace logging using the trace_action() and trace_message() APIs. Trace logging is a great way to make sure that logging context is always captured (since the last 10 trace logs are always available) without cluttering up the console or eval transcripts.\n\ntrace_action()\nUse the trace_action() context manager to collect data on the resolution (e.g. succeeded, cancelled, failed, timed out, etc.) and duration of actions. For example, let’s say you are interacting with a remote content database:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import trace_action\n\nfrom logging import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n\nserver = \"https://contentdb.example.com\"\nquery = \"&lt;content-db-query&gt;\"\n\nwith trace_action(logger, \"ContentDB\", f\"{server}: {query}\"):\n    # perform content database query\nYour custom trace actions will be reported alongside the standard traced actions in inspect trace anomalies, inspect trace dump, etc.\n\n\ntrace_message()\nUse the trace_message() function to trace events that don’t fall into enter/exit pattern supported by trace_action(). For example, let’s say you want to track every invocation of a custom tool:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import trace_message\n\nfrom logging import getLogger\nlogger = getLogger(__name__)\n\ntrace_message(logger, \"MyTool\", \"message related to tool\")",

    "text": "Eval Retries\nWhen an evaluation task fails due to an error or is otherwise interrupted (e.g. by a Ctrl+C), an evaluation log is still written. In many cases errors are transient (e.g. due to network connectivity or a rate limit) and can be subsequently retried.\nFor these cases, Inspect includes an eval-retry command and eval_retry() function that you can use to resume tasks interrupted by errors (including preserving samples already completed within the original task). For example, if you had a failing task with log file logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_Gprr29Mv.json, you could retry it from the shell with:\n$ inspect eval-retry logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\nOr from Python with:\neval_retry(\"logs/2024-05-29T12-38-43_math_43_math_Gprr29Mv.json\")\nNote that retry only works for tasks that are created from @task decorated functions (as if a Task is created dynamically outside of an @task function Inspect does not know how to reconstruct it for the retry).\nNote also that eval_retry() does not overwrite the previous log file, but rather creates a new one (preserving the task_id from the original file).\nHere’s an example of retrying a failed eval with a lower number of max_connections (the theory being that too many concurrent connections may have caused a rate limit error):\nlog = eval(my_task)[0]\nif log.status != \"success\":\n  eval_retry(log, max_connections = 3)",

    "text": "Failure Threshold\nIn some cases you might wish to tolerate some number of errors without failing the evaluation. This might be during development when errors are more commonplace, or could be to deal with a particularly unreliable API used in the evaluation. Add the fail_on_error option to your Task definition to establish this threshold. For example, here we indicate that we’ll tolerate errors in up to 10% of the total sample count before failing:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        fail_on_error=0.1,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nFailed samples are not scored and a warning indicating that some samples failed is both printed in the terminal and shown in Inspect View when this occurs.\nYou can specify fail_on_error as a boolean (turning the behaviour on and off entirely), as a number between 0 and 1 (indicating a proportion of failures to tolerate), or a number greater than 1 to (indicating a count of failures to tolerate):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nBehaviour\n\n\n\n\nfail_on_error=True\nFail eval immediately on sample errors (default).\n\n\nfail_on_error=False\nNever fail eval on sample errors.\n\n\nfail_on_error=0.1\nFail if more than 10% of total samples have errors.\n\n\nfail_on_error=5\nFail eval if more than 5 samples have errors.\n\n\n\nWhile fail_on_error is typically specified at the Task level, you can also override the task setting when calling eval() or inspect eval from the CLI.

    "section": "Sample Limits",
    "text": "Sample Limits\nIn open-ended model conversations (for example, an agent evaluation with tool usage) it’s possible that a model will get “stuck” attempting to perform a task with no realistic prospect of completing it. Further, sometimes models will call commands in a sandbox that take an extremely long time (or worst case, hang indefinitely).\nFor this type of evaluation it’s normally a good idea to set sample level limits on some combination of total time, total messages, and/or tokens used. Sample limits don’t result in errors, but rather an early exit from execution (samples that encounter limits are still scored, albeit nearly always as “incorrect”).\n\nTime Limit\nHere we set a time_limit of 15 minutes (15 x 60 seconds) for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=3 * 60)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        time_limit=15 * 60,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nNote that we also set a timeout of 3 minutes for the bash() command. This isn’t required but is often a good idea so that a single wayward bash command doesn’t consume the entire time_limit.\nWe can also specify a time limit at the CLI or when calling eval():\ninspect eval ctf.py --time-limit 900\nAppropriate timeouts will vary depending on the nature of your task so please view the above as examples only rather than recommend values.\n\n\nWorking Limit\nThe working_limit differs from the time_limit in that it measures only the time spent working (as opposed to retrying in response to rate limits or waiting on other shared resources). Working time is computed based on total clock time minus time spent on (a) unsuccessful model generations (e.g. rate limited requests); and (b) waiting on shared resources (e.g. Docker containers or subprocess execution).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to distinguish successful generate requests from rate limited and retried requests, Inspect installs hooks into the HTTP client of various model packages. This is not possible for some models (azureai and goodfire) and in these cases the working_time will include any internal retries that the model client performs.\n\n\n\nHere we set an working_limit of 10 minutes (10 x 60 seconds) for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=3 * 60)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        working_limit=10 * 60,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\n\n\nMessage Limit\nMessage limits enforce a limit on the number of messages in any conversation (e.g. a TaskState, AgentState, or any input to generate()).\nMessage limits are checked:\n\nWhenever you call generate() on any model. A LimitExceededError will be raised if the number of messages passed in input parameter to generate() is equal to or exceeds the limit. This is to avoid proceeding to another (wasteful) generate call if we’re already at the limit.\nWhenever TaskState.messages or AgentState.messages is mutated, but a LimitExceededError is only raised if the count exceeds the limit.\n\nHere we set a message_limit of 30 for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        message_limit=30,\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\nThis sets a limit of 30 total messages in a conversation before the model is forced to give up. At that point, whatever output happens to be in the TaskState will be scored (presumably leading to a score of incorrect).\n\n\nToken Limit\nToken usage (using total_tokens of ModelUsage) is automatically recorded for all models. Token limits are checked whenever generate() is called.\nHere we set a token_limit of 500K for each sample within a task:\n@task\ndef intercode_ctf():\n    return Task(\n        dataset=read_dataset(),\n        solver=[\n            system_message(\"system.txt\"),\n            use_tools([bash(timeout=120)]),\n            generate(),\n        ],\n        token_limit=(1024*500),\n        scorer=includes(),\n        sandbox=\"docker\",\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt’s important to note that the token_limit is for all tokens used within the execution of a sample. If you want to limit the number of tokens that can be yielded from a single call to the model you should use the max_tokens generation option.\n\n\n\n\nCustom Limit\nWhen limits are exceeded, a LimitExceededError is raised and caught by the main Inspect sample execution logic. If you want to create custom limit types, you can enforce them by raising a LimitExceededError as follows:\nfrom inspect_ai.util import LimitExceededError\n\nraise LimitExceededError(\n    \"custom\", \n    value=value,\n    limit=limit,\n    message=f\"A custom limit was exceeded: {value}\"\n)\n\n\nQuery Usage\nWe can determine how much of a sample limit has been used, what the limit is, and how much of the resource is remaining:\nsample_time_limit = sample_limits().time\nprint(f\"{sample_time_limit.remaining:.0f} seconds remaining\")\nNote that sample_limits() only retrieves the sample-level limits, not scoped limits or agent limits.",

For example:\nwith token_limit(1024*500):\n    ...\nA LimitExceededError will be raised if the limit is exceeded. The source field on LimitExceededError will be set to the Limit instance that was exceeded.\nWhen catching LimitExceededError, ensure that your try block encompasses the usage of the limit context manager as some LimitExceededError exceptions are raised at the scope of closing the context manager:\ntry:\n    with token_limit(1024*500):\n        ...\nexcept LimitExceededError:\n    ...\nThe apply_limits() function accepts a list of Limit instances. If any of the limits passed in are exceeded, the limit_error property on the LimitScope yielded when opening the context manager will be set to the exception. By default, all LimitExceededError exceptions are propagated. However, if catch_errors is true, errors which are as a direct result of exceeding one of the limits passed to it will be caught. It will always allow LimitExceededError exceptions triggered by other limits (e.g. Sample scoped limits) to propagate up the call stack.\nwith apply_limits(\n    [token_limit(1000), message_limit(10)], catch_errors=True\n) as limit_scope:\n    ...\nif limit_scope.limit_error:\n    print(f\"One of our limits was hit: {limit_scope.limit_error}\")\n\nChecking Usage\nYou can query how much of a limited resource has been used so far via the usage property of a scoped limit. For example:\nwith token_limit(10_000) as limit:\n    await generate()\n    print(f\"Used {limit.usage:,} of 10,000 tokens\")\nIf you’re passing the limit instance to apply_limits() or an agent and want to query the usage, you should keep a reference to it:\nlimit = token_limit(10_000)\nwith apply_limits([limit]):\n    await generate()\n    print(f\"Used {limit.usage:,} of 10,000 tokens\")\n\n\nTime Limit\nTo limit the wall clock time to 15 minutes within a block of code:\nwith time_limit(15 * 60):\n    ...\nInternally, this uses anyio’s cancellation scopes. The block will be cancelled at the first yield point (e.g. await statement).\n\n\nWorking Limit\nThe working_limit differs from the time_limit in that it measures only the time spent working (as opposed to retrying in response to rate limits or waiting on other shared resources).
