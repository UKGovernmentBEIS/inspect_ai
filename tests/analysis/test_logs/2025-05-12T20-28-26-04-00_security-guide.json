However, the term \"sanitize\" may encompass a broader approach that includes output encoding as part of internal processes.\n   - **Escape Outputs**: This is closely related to output encoding and aligns with the expert's recommendation of ensuring data is properly encoded before rendering.\n   - **Implement Secure Coding Practices**: This is a general principle that can cover multiple strategies, including both input validation and output encoding.\n\n3. **Matching Content**: \n   - The submission discusses *input validation*, which is present in the expert's answer.\n   - The concept of *output encoding* is implied by \"escape outputs,\" suggesting a recognition of the need to handle output safely.\n   - The expert's mention of using \"secure by default libraries\" is not directly addressed in the submission, but the general idea of secure coding practices may encompass this approach.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   - While the submission introduces additional relevant techniques not cited by the expert (like CSP) and integrates core concepts (input validation and output encoding), it does accurately reflect the key points made by the expert—specifically, the emphasis on input validation and the principle behind output handling.\n   - Therefore, while the submission expands on the subject, it retains the essential content suggested by the expert.\n\nBased on this analysis, the submission is considered correct in relation to the expert’s statements.\n\nGRADE: C",
