title: Using Models

## Overview

Inspect has support for a wide variety of language model APIs and can be extended to support arbitrary additional ones. Support for the following providers is built in to Inspect:

{{< include _model-providers.md >}}

Below we'll describe various ways to specify and provide options to models in Inspect evaluations. Review this first, then see the provider-specific sections for additional usage details and available options.

## Selecting a Model

To select a model for an evaluation, pass it's name on the command line or use the `model` argument of the `eval()` function:

``` bash
inspect eval arc.py --model openai/gpt-4o-mini
inspect eval arc.py --model anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
```

Or:

``` python
eval("arc.py", model="openai/gpt-4o-mini")
eval("arc.py", model="anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-latest")
```

Alternatively, you can set the `INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL` environment variable (either in the shell or a `.env` file) to select a model externally:

``` bash
INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=google/gemini-1.5-pro
```

## Generation Config

There are a variety of configuration options that affect the behaviour of model generation. There are options which affect the generated tokens (`temperature`, `top_p`, etc.) as well as the connection to model providers (`timeout`, `max_retries`, etc.)

You can specify generation options either on the command line or in direct calls to `eval()`. For example:

``` bash
inspect eval arc.py --model openai/gpt-4 --temperature 0.9
inspect eval arc.py --model google/gemini-1.0-pro --max-connections 20
```

Or:

``` python
eval("arc.py", model="openai/gpt-4", temperature=0.9)
eval("arc.py", model="google/gemini-1.0-pro", max_connections=20)
```

Use `inspect eval --help` to learn about all of the available generation config options.

## Model Args

If there is an additional aspect of a model you want to tweak that isn't covered by the `GenerateConfig`, you can use model args to pass additional arguments to model clients. For example, here we specify the `transport` option for a Google Gemini model:

``` bash
inspect eval arc.py --model google/gemini-1.0-pro -M transport:grpc
```

See the documentation for the requisite model provider for information on how model args are passed through to model clients.

## Max Connections

Inspect uses an asynchronous architecture to run task samples in parallel. If your model provider can handle 100 concurrent connections, then Inspect can utilise all of those connections to get the highest possible throughput. The limiting factor on parallelism is therefore not typically local parallelism (e.g. number of cores) but rather what the underlying rate limit is for your interface to the provider.

By default, Inspect uses a `max_connections` value of 10. You can increase this consistent with your account limits. If you are experiencing rate-limit errors you will need to experiment with the `max_connections` option to find the optimal value that keeps you under the rate limit (the section on [Parallelism](parallelism.qmd) includes additional documentation on how to do this).
