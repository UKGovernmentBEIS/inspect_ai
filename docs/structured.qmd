title: "Structured Output"

## Overview

Structured output is a feature supported by some model providers to ensure that models generate responses which adhere to a supplied JSON Schema. Structured output is currently supported in Inspect for the OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, Grok, Groq, vLLM, and SGLang providers.

While structured output may seem like a robust solution to model unreliability, it's important to keep in mind that by specifying a JSON schema you are also introducing unknown effects on model task performance. There is even some early literature indicating that [models perform worse with structured output](https://dylancastillo.co/posts/say-what-you-mean-sometimes.html).

You should therefore test the use of structured output as an elicitation technique like you would any other, and only proceed if you feel confident that it has made a genuine improvement in your overall task.

## Example

Below we'll walk through a simple example of using structured output to constrain model output to a `Color` type that provides red, green, and blue components. If you want to experiment with it further, see the [source code](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/examples/structured.py) in the Inspect GitHub repository.

Imagine first that we have the following dataset:

```python
from inspect_ai.dataset import Sample

colors_dataset=[
    Sample(
        input="What is the RGB color for white?",
        target="255,255,255",
    ),
    Sample(
        input="What is the RGB color for black?",
        target="0,0,0",
    ),
]
```

We want the model to give us the RGB values for the colors, but it might choose to output these colors in a wide variety of formats---parsing these formats in our scorer could be laborious and error prone.

Here we define a [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) `Color` type that we'd like to get back from the model:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Color(BaseModel):
    red: int
    green: int
    blue: int
```

To instruct the model to return output in this type, we use the `response_schema` generate config option, using the `json_schema()` function to produce a schema for our type. Here is complete task definition which uses the dataset and color type from above:

```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task
from inspect_ai.model import GenerateConfig, ResponseSchema
from inspect_ai.solver import generate
from inspect_ai.util import json_schema

@task
def rgb_color():
    return Task(
        dataset=colors_dataset,
        solver=generate(),
        scorer=score_color(),
        config=GenerateConfig(
            response_schema=ResponseSchema(
              name="color", 
              json_schema=json_schema(Color)
            )
        ),
    )
```

We use the `json_schema()` function to create a JSON schema for our `Color` type, then wrap that in a `ResponseSchema` where we also assign it a name.

You'll also notice that we have specified a custom scorer. We need this to both parse and evaluate our custom type (as models still return JSON output as a string). Here is the scorer:

```python
from inspect_ai.scorer import (
    CORRECT,
    INCORRECT,
    Score,
    Target,
    accuracy,
    scorer,
    stderr,
)
from inspect_ai.solver import TaskState

@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])
def score_color():
    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):
        try:
            color = Color.model_validate_json(state.output.completion)
            if f"{color.red},{color.green},{color.blue}" == target.text:
                value = CORRECT
            else:
                value = INCORRECT
            return Score(
                value=value,
                answer=state.output.completion,
            )
        except ValidationError as ex:
            return Score(
                value=INCORRECT,
                answer=state.output.completion,
                explanation=f"Error parsing response: {ex}",
            )

    return score
```

The Pydantic `Color` type has a convenient `model_validate_json()` method which we can use to read the model's output (being sure to catch the `ValidationError` if the model produces incorrect output).

## Schema

The `json_schema()` function supports creating schemas for any Python type including Pydantic models, dataclasses, and typed dicts. That said, Pydantic models are highly recommended as they provide additional parsing and validation which is generally required for scorers.

The `response_schema` generation config option takes a `ResponseSchema` object which includes the schema and some additional fields:

```python
from inspect_ai.model import ResponseSchema
from inspect_ai.util import json_schema

config = GenerateConfig(
  response_schema=ResponseSchema(
    name="color",                   # required name field 
    json_schema=json_schema(Color), # schema for custom type
    description="description",      # optional field with more context
    strict=False                    # force model to adhere to schema
  )
)
```

Note that not all model providers support all of these options. In particular, only the Mistral and OpenAI providers support the `name`, `description`, and `strict` fields (the Google provider takes the `json_schema` only). 

You should therefore never assume that specifying `strict` gets your scorer off the hook for parsing and validating the model output as some models won't respect `strict`. Using `strict` may also impact task performance---as always it's best to experiment and measure!


## vLLM/SGLang API

The vLLM and SGLang providers support structured output from JSON schemas as above, as well as in the choice, regex, and context free grammar formats. This is currently implemented through the `extra_body` field in the `GenerateConfig` object. See the docs for [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/features/structured_outputs.html) and [SGLang](https://docs.sglang.ai/backend/structured_outputs.html) for more details.

The key names for each guided decoding format differ between vLLM and SGLang:

| Format      | vLLM key         | SGLang key |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Choice      | `guided_choice`  | `choice`   |
| Regex       | `guided_regex`   | `regex`    |
| Grammar     | `guided_grammar` | `ebnf`     |

Below are example usages for each format.  

### Guided Choice Decoding

```python
config = GenerateConfig(
    extra_body={
        "guided_choice": ["RGB: 255,255,255", "RGB: 0,0,0"]  # vLLM
        # "choice": ["RGB: 255,255,255", "RGB: 0,0,0"]       # SGLang
    }
)
```

### Guided Regex Decoding

```python
config = GenerateConfig(
    extra_body={
        "guided_regex": r"RGB: (\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})"  # vLLM
        # "regex": r"RGB: (\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3}),(\d{1,3})"       # SGLang
    }
)
```

### Guided Context Free Grammar Decoding

```python
grammar = """
root ::= rgb_color
rgb_color ::= "RGB: " rgb_values
rgb_values ::= number "," number "," number
number ::= digit | digit digit | digit digit digit
digit ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
"""

config = GenerateConfig(
    extra_body={
        "guided_grammar": grammar  # vLLM
        # "ebnf": grammar          # SGLang
    }
)
```
