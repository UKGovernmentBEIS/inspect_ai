title: Approval

## Overview

Inspect's approval mode enables you to create fine-grained policies for approving tool calls made by models. For example, the following are all supported:

1.  All tool calls are approved by a human operator.
2.  Select tool calls are approved by a human operator (the rest being executed without approval).
3.  Custom approvers that decide to either approve, reject, or escalate to another approver.

Custom approvers are very flexible, and can implement a wide variety of decision schemes including informal heuristics and assessments by models. They could also support human approval with a custom user interface on a remote system (whereby approvals are sent and received via message queues).

## Human Approver

The simplest approval policy is interactive human approval of all tool calls. You can enable this policy by using the `--approval human` CLI option (or the `approval = "human"`) argument to `eval()`:

``` bash
inspect eval browser.py --approval human --trace
```

Note that we also enable [trace mode](interactivity.qmd#sec-trace-mode) so that we can see all messages exchanged with the model for context. This example provides the model with the built-in [web browser](tools.qmd#sec-web-browser) tool and asks it to navigate to a web and perform a search.

## Auto Approver

Whenever you enable approval mode, all tool calls must be handled in some fashion (otherwise they are rejected). However, approving every tool call can be quite tedious, and not all tool calls are necessarily worthy of human oversight.

You can chain to together the `human` and `auto` approvers in an *approval policy* to only approve selected tool calls. For example, here we create a policy that asks for human approval of only interactive web browser tool calls:

``` yaml
approvers:
  - name: human
    tools: ["web_browser_click", "web_browser_type*"]

  - name: auto
    tools: "*"
```

Navigational web browser tool calls (e.g. `web_browser_go`) are approved automatically via the catch-all `auto` approver at the end of the chain. Note that when listing an approver in a policy you indicate which tools it should handle using a glob or list of globs.

To use this policy, pass the path to the policy YAML file as the approver. For example:

``` bash
inspect eval browser.py --approval approval.yaml --trace
```

## Approvers in Code

We've demonstrated configuring approvers via a YAML approval policy file—you can also provide a policy directly in code (useful if it needs to be more dynamic). Here's a pure Python version of the example from the previous section:

``` python
from inspect_ai import eval
from inspect_ai.approval import ApprovalPolicy, human_approver, auto_approver

approval = [
    ApprovalPolicy(human_approver(), ["web_browser_click", "web_browser_type*"]),
    ApprovalPolicy(auto_approver(), "*")
]

eval("browser.py", approval=approval, trace=True)
```

## Custom Approvers

Inspect includes two built-an approvers: `human` for interactive approval at the terminal and `auto` for automatically approving or rejecting specific tools. You can also create your own approvers that implement just about any scheme you can imagine.

Custom approvers are functions that return an `Approval`, which consists of a decision and an explanation. Here is the source code for the `auto` approver, which just reflects back the decision that it is initialised with:

``` python
@approver(name="auto")
def auto_approver(decision: ApprovalDecision = "approve") -> Approver:
    
    async def approve(
        message: str,
        call: ToolCall,
        view: ToolCallView,
        state: TaskState | None = None,
    ) -> Approval:
        return Approval(decision=decision, explanation="Automatic decision.")

    return approve
```

There are five possible approval decisions:

| Decision | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| approve | The tool call is approved |
| modify | The tool call is approved with modification (included in `modified` field of `Approver`) |
| reject | The tool call is rejected (report to the model that the call was rejected along with an explanation) |
| escalate | The tool call should be escalated to the next approver in the chain. |
| terminate | The current sample should be terminated as a result of the tool call. |


Here's a more complicated custom approver that implements an allow list for bash commands. Imagine that we've implemented this approver within a Python package named `evaltools`:

``` python
@approver
def bash_allowlist(
    allowed_commands: list[str],
    allow_sudo: bool = False,
    command_specific_rules: dict[str, list[str]] | None = None,
) -> Approver:
    """Create an approver that checks if a bash command is in an allowed list."""

    async def approve(
        message: str,
        call: ToolCall,
        view: ToolCallView,
        state: TaskState | None = None,
    ) -> Approval:

        # Make approval decision
        
        ...

    return approve
```

Assuming we have properly [registered our approver](extensions.qmd#sec-extensions-approvers) as an Inspect extension, we can then use this it in an approval policy:

``` yaml
approvers:
  - name: evaltools/bash_allowlist
    tools: "*bash*"
    allowed_commands: ["ls", "echo", "cat"]

  - name: human
    tools: "*"
```

These approvers will make one of the following approval decisions for each tool call they are configured to handle:

1)  Allow the tool call (based on the various configured options)
2)  Disallow the tool call (because it is considered dangerous under all conditions)
3)  Escalate the tool call to the human approver.

Note that the human approver is last and is bound to all tools, so escalations from the bash and python allow list approvers will end up prompting the human approver.

See the documentation on [Approver Extensions](extensions.qmd#sec-extensions-approvers) for additional details on publishing approvers within Python packages.


## Tool Views

By default, when a tool call is presented for human approval the tool function and its arguments are printed. For some tool calls this is adequate, but some tools can benefit from enhanced presentation. For example:

1)  The interactive features of the web browser tool (clicking, typing, submitting forms, etc.) reference an `element_id`, however this ID isn't enough context to approve or reject the call. To compensate, the web browser tool provides some additional context (a snippet of the page around the `element_id` being interacted with).

2)  The `bash()` and `python()` tools take their input as a string, which especially for multi-line commands can be difficult to read and understand. To compensate, these tools provide an alternative view of the call that formats the code and as multi-line syntax highlighted code block.

### Example

Here's how you might implement a custom code block viewer for a bash tool:

``` python
from inspect_ai.tool import (
    Tool, ToolCall, ToolCallContent, ToolCallView, ToolCallViewer, tool
)

# custom viewer for bash code blocks
def bash_viewer() -> ToolCallViewer:
    def viewer(tool_call: ToolCall) -> ToolCallView:
        code = tool_call.arguments.get("cmd", tool_call.function).strip()
        call = ToolCallContent(
            format="markdown",
            content="**bash**\n\n```bash\n" + code + "\n```\n",
        )
        return ToolCallView(call=call)

    return viewer


@tool(viewer=bash_viewer())
def bash(timeout: int | None = None) -> Tool:
    """Bash shell command execution tool.
    ...
```

The `ToolCallViewer` gets passed the `ToolCall` and returns a `ToolCallView` that provides one or both of `context` (additional information for understand the call) and `call` (alternate rendering of the call). In the case of the bash tool we provide a markdown code block rendering of the bash code to be executed.

The `context` is typically used for stateful tools that need to present some context from the current state. For example, the web browsing tool provides a snippet from the currently loaded page.
