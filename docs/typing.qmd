## Overview

The Inspect codebase is written using strict [MyPy](https://mypy-lang.org/) type-checking---if you enable the same for your project along with installing the [MyPy VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.mypy-type-checker) you'll benefit from all of these type definitions.

There are some components of Inspect that are weakly typed to accomodate arbitrary user data structures. This includes:

- Sample metadata
- Sample store 

Below, we describe how to implement [typed metadata](#typed-metadata) and a [typed store](#typed-store) using Pydantic models.
