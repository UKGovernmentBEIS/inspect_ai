# Parallelism {#sec-parallelism}

## Overview

Inspect runs evaluations using a parallel async architecture, eagerly executing many samples in parallel while at the same time ensuring that that resources aren't over-saturated by enforcing various limits (e.g. maximum number of concurrent model connections, maximum number of subprocesses, etc.).

There are a progression of concurrency concerns, and while most evaluations can rely on the Inspect default behaviour, others will benefit from more customisation. Below we'll cover the following:

1.  Model API connection concurrency.
2.  Evaluating multiple models in parallel.
3.  Evaluating mulitple tasks in paralle. 
3.  Sandbox environment concurrency.
4.  Writing parallel code in custom tools, solvers, and scorers.

## Model Connections

### Max Connections

Connections to model APIs are the most fundamental unit of concurrency to manage. The main thing that limits model API concurrency is not local compute or network availability, but rather *rate limits* imposed by model API providers. Here we run an evaluation and set the maximum connections to 20:

``` bash
$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-connections 20
```

The default value for max connections is 10. By increasing it we might get better performance due to higher parallelism, however we might get *worse* performance if this causes us to frequently hit rate limits (which are retried with exponential backoff). The "correct" max connections for your evaluations will vary based on your actual rate limit and the size and complexity of your evaluations.

### Rate Limits

When you run an eval you'll see information reported on the current active connection usage as well as the number of HTTP rate limit errors that have been encountered (note that Inspect will automatically retry on rate limits and other errors likely to be transient):

![](images/rate-limit.png){fig-alt="The Inspect task results displayed in the terminal. The number of HTTP rate limit errors that have occurred (25) is printed in the bottom right of the task results."}

Here we've set a higher max connections than the default (30). While you might be tempted to set this very high to see how much concurrent traffic you can sustain, more often than not setting too high a max connections will result in slower evaluations, because retries are done using [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff), and bouncing off of rate limits too frequently will have you waiting minutes for retries to fire.

You should experiment with various values for max connections at different times of day (evening is often very different than daytime!). Generally speaking, you want to see some number of HTTP rate limits enforced so you know that are somewhere close to ideal utilisation, but if you see hundreds of these you are likely over-saturating and experiencing a net slowdown.

### Limiting Retries

By default, inspect will continue to retry model API calls (with exponential backoff) indefinitely when a rate limit error (HTTP status 429) is returned . You can limit these retries by using the `max_retries` and `timeout` eval options. For example:

``` bash
$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-retries 10 --timeout 600
```

If you want more insight into Model API connections and retries, specify `log_level=http`. For example:

``` bash
$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --log-level=http
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Note that max connections is applied per-model. This means that if you use a grader model from a provider distinct from the one you are evaluating you will get extra concurrency (as each model will enforce its own max connections).

## Multiple Models {#sec-multiple-models}

You can evaluate multiple models in parallel by passing a list of models to the `eval()` function. For example:

``` python
eval("mathematics.py", model=[
    "openai/gpt-4-turbo",
    "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "google/gemini-1.5-pro"
])
```

![](images/inspect-multiple-models.png){fig-alt="An evaluation task display show the progress for 3 differnet models."}

Since each model provider has its own `max_connections` they don't contend with each other for resources. If you need to evaluate multiple models, doing so concurrently is highly recommended.

If you want to specify multiple models when using the `--model` CLI argument or `INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL` environment variable, just separate the model names with commas. For example:

``` bash
INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=openai/gpt-4-turbo,google/gemini-1.5-pro
```

## Multiple Tasks {#sec-multiple-tasks}

By default, Inspect runs a single task at a time. This is because most tasks consist of 10 or more samples, which generally means that sample parallelism is enough to make full use of the `max_connections` defined for the active model. If however, the number samples per task is substantially lower than `max_connections` then you might benefit from running multiple tasks in parallel.

There is one important constraint on task parallelism to note: by default, all of the tasks *must share a working directory* (as Inspect switches to the working directory of tasks when executing them). This constraint can be relaxed using the `chdir=False` option on the `@task` decorator (see the discussion in [Working Directory](#working-directory) below for details).

### Max Tasks Option

Run multiple tasks in parallel using the `--max-tasks` CLI option or `max_tasks` parameter to the `eval()` function. For example, here we run all of the tasks in the current working directory with up 5 tasks run in parallel:

``` bash
$ inspect eval . --max-tasks=5 
```

Another common scenario is running the same task with variations of hyperparameters (e.g. prompts, generation config, etc.). For example:

``` python
tasks = [
    Task(
        dataset=csv_dataset("dataset.csv"),
        plan=[system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE), generate()],
        scorer=match(),
        config=GenerateConfig(temperature=temperature),
    )
    for temperature in [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]
]

eval(tasks, max_tasks=5)
```

It's critical to reinforce that this will only provide a performance gain if the number of samples is very small. For example, If the dataset contains 10 samples and your `max_connections` is 10, there is no gain to be had by running tasks in parallel.

Note that you can combine parallel tasks with parallel models as follows:

``` python
eval(
    tasks, # 6 tasks for various temperature values
    model=["openai/gpt-4o", "anthropic/claude-3-haiku-20240307"],
    max_tasks=5,
)
```

This code will evaluate a total of 12 tasks (6 temperature variations against 2 models each) with up to 5 tasks run in parallel.

### Working Directory {#working-directory}

By default, inspect both *loads* and *executes* tasks within the directory that contains the task source file. This is done so that relative references to Python modules, datasets, prompt templates, and other resources are resolved correctly.

Since task parallelism requires that tasks are executed from within the same working directory, you may want to change this default behaviour. You can do this using the `chdir` option of the `@task` decorator. For example:

``` python
@task(chdir=False)
def my_task():
  ...
```

Note that this only affects where tasks are *executed*. Even with `chdir=False` task files are still *loaded* within their parent directory (so Python modules, datasets, prompts, etc. will still resolve correctly with relative references). If however you are making reference to external files at *runtime* (e.g. within the `solve()` or `score()` method of a `Sovler` or `Scorer`) you'll need to be sure to not rely on relative path resolution when `chdir=False`.

## Sandbox Environments {#sec-parallel-tool-environments}

[Sandbox Environments](#sec-sandbox-environments) (e.g. Docker containers) often allocate resources on a per-sample basis, and also make use of the Inspect `subprocess()` function for executing commands within the environment.

### Max Samples

The `max_samples` option determines how many samples are executed in parallel (and in the case of Docker containers how many containers are run in parallel). By default, `max_samples` is set to `max_connections` so that the connection to the Model API can be fully utilised.

Since sandbox enviroinments include additional expensive operations beyond calling models, you may want to increase `max_samples` to fully saturate both the Model API and container subprocesses used for tool execution. When running an evaluation you'll see an indicator of how many connections and how many subprocesses are currently active. If neither is at capacity then you will likely benefit from increasing `max_samples`.

Note that setting `max_samples` to an arbitrarily high number does have some disadvantages: you will consume more memory (especially if using sandbox environments) as well as wait longer for completed samples to be logged (so could be subject to losing more work if your eval task fails).

### Max Subprocesses

The `max_subprocesses` option determines how many subprocesses calls can run in parallel. By defualt, this is set to `os.cpu_count()`. Depending on the nature of execution done inside sandbox environments, you might benefit from increasing or decreasting `max_subprocesses`.

## Solvers and Scorers {#sec-parallel-solvers-and-scorers}

### REST APIs

It's possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will call other REST APIs. Two things to keep in mind when doing this are:

1.  It's critical that connections to other APIs use `async` HTTP APIs (i.e. the `httpx` model rather than the `requests` module). This is because Inspect's parallelism relies on everything being `async`, so if you make a blocking HTTP call with `requests` it will actually hold up all of the rest of the work in system!

2.  As with model APIs, rate limits may be in play, so it's important not to over-saturate these connections. Recall that Inspect runs all samples in parallel so if you have 500 samples and don't do anything to limit concurrency, you will likely end up making hundreds of calls at a time to the API.

Here's some (oversimplified) example code that illustrates how to call a REST API within an Inspect component. We use the `async` interface of the `httpx` module, and we use Inspect's `concurrency()` function to limit simultaneous connections to 10:

``` python
import httpx
from inspect_ai.util import concurrency
from inspect_ai.solver import Generate, TaskState

client = httpx.AsyncClient()

async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):
  ...
  # wrap the call to client.get() in an async concurrency 
  # block to limit simultaneous connections to 10
  async with concurrency("my-rest-api", 10):
    response = await client.get("https://example.com/api")
```

Note that we pass a name ("my-rest-api") to the `concurrency()` function. This provides a named scope for managing concurrency for calls to that specific API/service.

### Parallel Code {#sec-parallel-code}

Generally speaking, you should try to make all of the code you write within Inspect solvers, tools, and scorers as parallel as possible. The main idea is to eagerly post as much work as you can, and then allow the various concurrency gates described above to take care of not overloading remote APIs or local resources. There are two keys to writing parallel code:

1.  Use `async` for all potentially expensive operations. If you are calling a remote API, use the `httpx.AsyncClient`. If you are running local code, use the `subprocess()` function described above.
2.  If your `async` work can be parallelised, do it using `asyncio.gather()`. For example, if you are calling three different model APIs to score a task, you can call them all in parallel. Or if you need to retrieve 10 web pages you don't need to do it in a loop—rather, you can fetch them all at once.

#### Model Requests

Let's say you have a scorer that uses three different models to score based on majority vote. You could make all of the model API calls in parallel as follows:

``` python
from inspect_ai.model import get_model

models = [
  get_model("openai/gpt-4"),
  get_model("anthropic/claude-3-sonnet-20240229"),
  get_model("mistral/mistral-large-latest")
]

output = "Output to be scored"
prompt = f"Could you please score the following output?\n\n{output}"

graders = [model.generate(prompt) for model in models]

grader_outputs = await asyncio.gather(*graders)
```

Note that we don't await the call to `model.generate()` when building our list of graders. Rather the call to `asyncio.gather()` will await each of these requests and return when they have all completed. Inspect's internal handling of `max_connections` for model APIs will apply to these requests, so you need now worry about how many you put in flight, they will be throttled as appropriate.

#### Web Requests

Here's an examples of using `asyncio.gather()` to parallelise web requests:

``` python
import asyncio
import httpx
client = httpx.AsyncClient()

pages = [
  "https://www.openai.com",
  "https://www.anthropic.com",
  "https://www.google.com",
  "https://mistral.ai/"
]

downloads = [client.get(page) for page in pages]

results = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)
```

Note that we don't `await` the client requests when building up our list of `downloads`. Rather, we let `asyncio.gather()` await all of them, returning only when all of the results are available. Compared to looping over each page download this will execute much, much quicker. Note that if you are sending requests to a REST API that might have rate limits, you should consider wrapping your HTTP requests in a `concurrency()` block. For example:

``` python
from inspect_ai.util import concurrency

async def download(page):
  async with concurrency("my-web-api", 2):
    return await client.get(page)
  
downloads = [download(page) for page in pages]

results = await asyncio.gather(*downloads)
```

### Subprocesses

It's possible that your custom solvers, tools, or scorers will need to launch child processes to perform various tasks. Subprocesses have similar considerations as calling APIs: you want to make sure that they don't block the rest of the work in Inspect (so they should be invoked with `async`) and you also want to make sure they don't provide *too much* concurrency (i.e. you wouldn't want to launch 200 processes at once on a 4 core machine!)

To assist with this, Inspect provides the `subprocess()` function. This `async` function takes a command and arguments and invokes the specified command asynchronously, collecting and returning stdout and stderr. The `subprocess()` function also automatically limits concurrent child processes to the number of CPUs on your system (`os.cpu_count()`). Here's an example from the implementation of a `list_files()` tool:

``` python
@tool
def list_files():
    async def execute(dir: str):
        """List the files in a directory.

        Args:
            dir (str): Directory

        Returns:
            File listing of the directory
        """
        result = await subprocess(["ls", dir])
        if result.success:
            return result.stdout
        else:
            raise ToolError(result.stderr)

    return execute
```

The maximum number of concurrent subprocesses can be modified using the `--max-subprocesses` option. For example:

``` bash
$ inspect eval --model openai/gpt-4 --max-subprocesses 4
```

Note that if you need to execute computationally expensive code in an eval, you should always factor it into a call to `subprocess()` so that you get optimal concurrency and performance.

#### Timeouts

If you need to ensure that your subprocess runs for no longer than a specified interval, you can use the `timeout` option. For example:

``` python
try:
  result = await subprocess(["ls", dir], timeout = 30)
except TimeoutError:
  ...
```

If a timeout occurs, then a `TimeoutError` will be thrown (which your code should generally handle in whatever manner is appropriate).
