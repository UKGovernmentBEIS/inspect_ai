title: Log Files
---

## Overview

Every time you use `inspect eval` or call the `eval()` function, an evaluation log is written for each task evaluated. By default, logs are written to the `./logs` sub-directory of the current working directory (we'll cover how to change this below). You will find a link to the log at the bottom of the results for each task:

``` bash
$ inspect eval security_guide.py --model openai/gpt-4
```

![](images/eval-log.png){fig-alt="The Inspect task results displayed in the terminal. A link to the evaluation log is at the bottom of the results display."}

You can also use the Inspect log viewer for interactive exploration of logs. Run this command once at the beginning of a working session (the view will update automatically when new evaluations are run):

``` bash
$ inspect view
```

![](images/inspect-view-main.png){.border .lightbox fig-alt="The Inspect log viewer, displaying a summary of results for the task as well as 8 individual samples."}

This section won't cover using `inspect view` though. Rather, it will cover the details of managing log usage from the CLI as well as the Python API for reading logs. See the [Log Viewer](#sec-log-viewer) section for details on interactively exploring logs.

## Log Location

By default, logs are written to the `./logs` sub-directory of the current working directory You can change where logs are written using eval options or an environment variable:

``` bash
$ inspect eval popularity.py --model openai/gpt-4 --log-dir ./experiment-log
```

Or:

``` python
log = eval(popularity, model="openai/gpt-4", log_dir = "./experiment-log")
```

Note that in addition to logging the `eval()` function also returns an `EvalLog` object for programmatic access to the details of the evaluation. We'll talk more about how to use this object below.

The `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` environment variable can also be specified to override the default `./logs` location. You may find it convenient to define this in a `.env` file from the location where you run your evals:

``` ini
INSPECT_LOG_DIR=./experiment-log
INSPECT_LOG_LEVEL=warning
```

If you define a relative path to `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` in a `.env` file, then its location will always be resolved as *relative to* that `.env` file (rather than relative to whatever your current working directory is when you run `inspect eval`).

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
If you are running in VS Code, then you should restart terminals and notebooks using Inspect when you change the `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` in a `.env` file. This is because the VS Code Python extension also [reads variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_environment-variables) from `.env` files, and your updated `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` won't be re-read by VS Code until after a restart.

See the [Amazon S3](#sec-amazon-s3) section below for details on logging evaluations to Amazon S3 buckets.

## Log Format {#sec-log-format}

Inspect log files use JSON to represent the hierarchy of data produced by an evaluation. Depending on your configuration and what version of Inspect you are running, the log JSON will be stored in one of two file types:

| Type | Description |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `.eval` | Binary file format optimised for size and speed. Typically 1/8 the size of `.json` files and accesses samples incrementally, yielding fast loading in Inspect View no matter the file size. |
| `.json` | Text file format with native JSON representation. Occupies substantially more disk space and can be slow to load in Inspect View if larger than 50MB. |

: {tbl-colwidths=\[20,80\]}

Both formats are fully supported by the [Log File API](#sec-log-file-api) and [Log Commands](#sec-log-commands) described below, and can be intermixed freely within a log directory.

### Format Option

Beginning with Inspect v0.3.46, `.eval` is the default log file format. You can explicitly control the global log format default in your `.env` file:

``` {.bash filename=".env"}
INSPECT_LOG_FORMAT=eval
```

Or specify it per-evaluation with the `--log-format` option:

``` bash
inspect eval ctf.py --log-format=eval
```

No matter which format you choose, the `EvalLog` returned from `eval()` will be the same, and the various APIs provided for log files (`read_eval_log()`, `write_eval_log()`, etc.) will also work the same.

::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple"}
The variability in underlying file format makes it especially important that you use the Python [Log File API](#sec-log-file-api) for reading and writing log files (as opposed to reading/writing JSON directly).

If you do need to interact with the underlying JSON (e.g., when reading logs from another language) see the [Log Commands](#sec-log-commands) section below which describes how to get the plain text JSON representation for any log file.
:::

## Image Logging

By default, full base64 encoded copies of images are included in the log file. Image logging will not create performance problems when using `.eval` logs, however if you are using `.json` logs then large numbers of images could become unwieldy (i.e. if your `.json` log file grows to 100mb or larger as a result).

You can disable this using the `--no-log-images` flag. For example, here we enable the `.json` log format and disable image logging:

``` bash
inspect eval images.py --log-format=json --no-log-images
```

You can also use the `INSPECT_EVAL_LOG_IMAGES` environment variable to set a global default in your `.env` configuration file.


## Log File API {#sec-log-file-api}

### EvalLog

The `EvalLog` object returned from `eval()` provides programmatic interface to the contents of log files:

**Class** `inspect_ai.log.EvalLog`

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| `version` | `int` | File format version (currently 2). |
| `status` | `str` | Status of evaluation (`"started"`, `"success"`, or `"error"`). |
| `eval` | `EvalSpec` | Top level eval details including task, model, creation time, etc. |
| `plan` | `EvalPlan` | List of solvers and model generation config used for the eval. |
| `results` | `EvalResults` | Aggregate results computed by scorer metrics. |
| `stats` | `EvalStats` | Model usage statistics (input and output tokens) |
| `error` | `EvalError` | Error information (if `status == "error`) including traceback. |
| `samples` | `list[EvalSample]` | Each sample evaluated, including its input, output, target, and score. |
| `reductions` | `list[EvalSampleReduction]` | Reductions of sample values for multi-epoch evaluations. |

Before analysing results from a log, you should always check their status to ensure they represent a successful run:

``` python
log = eval(popularity, model="openai/gpt-4")
if log.status == "success":
   ...
```

In the section below we'll talk more about how to deal with logs from failed evaluations (e.g. retrying the eval).

### Location

The `EvalLog` object returned from `eval()` and `read_eval_log()` has a `location` property that indicates the storage location it was written to or read from.

The `write_eval_log()` function will use this `location` if it isn't passed an explicit `location` to write to. This enables you to modify the contents of a log file return from `eval()` as follows:

``` python
log = eval(my_task())[0]
# edit EvalLog as required
write_eval_log(log)
```

Or alternatively for an `EvalLog` read from a filesystem:

``` python
log = read_eval_log(log_file_path)
# edit EvalLog as required
write_eval_log(log)
```

If you are working with the results of an [Eval Set](eval-sets.qmd), the returned logs are headers rather than the full log with all samples. If you want to edit logs returned from `eval_set` you should read them fully, edit them, and then write them. For example:

``` python
success, logs = eval_set(tasks)
 
for log in logs:
    log = read_eval_log(log.location)
    # edit EvalLog as required
    write_eval_log(log)
```

Note that the `EvalLog.location` is a URI rather than a traditional file path(e.g. it could be a `file://` URI, an `s3://` URI or any other URI supported by [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/)).

### Functions

You can enumerate, read, and write `EvalLog` objects using the following helper functions from the `inspect_ai.log` module:

| Function | Description |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `list_eval_logs` | List all of the eval logs at a given location. |
| `read_eval_log` | Read an `EvalLog` from a log file path (pass `header_only` to not read samples, `include_etag=True` to get ETag for S3 conditional writes). |
| `read_eval_log_sample` | Read a single `EvalSample` from a log file |
| `read_eval_log_samples` | Read all samples incrementally (returns a generator that yields samples one at a time). |
| `read_eval_log_sample_summaries` | Read a summary of all samples (including scoring for each sample). |
| `write_eval_log` | Write an `EvalLog` to a log file path (pass `if_match_etag` for S3 conditional writes). |

A common workflow is to define an `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` for running a set of evaluations, then calling `list_eval_logs()` to analyse the results when all the work is done:

``` python
# setup log dir context
os.environ["INSPECT_LOG_DIR"] = "./experiment-logs"

# do a bunch of evals
eval(popularity, model="openai/gpt-4")
eval(security_guide, model="openai/gpt-4")

# analyze the results in the logs
logs = list_eval_logs()
```

Note that `list_eval_logs()` lists log files recursively. Pass `recursive=False` to list only the log files at the root level.

### Log Headers

Eval log files can get quite large (multiple GB) so it is often useful to read only the header, which contains metadata and aggregated scores. Use the `header_only` option to read only the header of a log file:

```python
log_header = read_eval_log(log_file, header_only=True)
```

The log header is a standard `EvalLog` object without the `samples` and `reductions` fields.

### Summaries

It may also be useful to read only the summary level information about samples (input, target, error status, and scoring). To do this, use the `read_eval_log_sample_summaries()` function:

```python
summaries = read_eval_log_sample_summaries(log_file)
```

The `summaries` are a list of `EvalSampleSummary` objects, one for each sample. Some sample data is "thinned" in the interest of keeping the summaries small: images are removed from `input`, `metadata` is restricted to scalar values (with strings truncated to 1k), and scores include only their `value`.

Reading only sample summaries will take orders of magnitude less time than reading all of the samples one-by-one, so if you only need access to summary level data, always prefer this function to reading the entire log file.

#### Filtering

You can also use `read_eval_log_sample_summaries()` as means of filtering which samples you want to read in full. For example, imagine you only want to read samples that include errors:

```python
errors: list[EvalSample] = []
for sample in read_eval_log_sample_summaries(log_file):
    if sample.error is not None
        errors.append(
            read_eval_log_sample(log_file, sample.id, sample.epoch)
        )
``` 

### Streaming

If you are working with log files that are too large to comfortably fit in memory, we recommend the following options and workflow to stream them rather than loading them into memory all at once :

1.  Use the `.eval` log file format which supports compression and incremental access to samples (see details on this in the [Log Format](#sec-log-format) section above). If you have existing `.json` files you can easily batch convert them to `.eval` using the [Log Commands](#converting-logs) described below.

2.  If you only need access to the "header" of the log file (which includes general eval metadata as well as the evaluation results) use the `header_only` option of `read_eval_log()`:

    ``` python
    log = read_eval_log(log_file, header_only = True)
    ```

3.  If you want to read individual samples, either read them selectively using `read_eval_log_sample()`, or read them iteratively using `read_eval_log_samples()` (which will ensure that only one sample at a time is read into memory):

    ``` python
    # read a single sample
    sample = read_eval_log_sample(log_file, id = 42)

    # read all samples using a generator
    for sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file):
        ...
    ```

Note that `read_eval_log_samples()` will raise an error if you pass it a log that does not have `status=="success"` (this is because it can't read all of the samples in an incomplete log). If you want to read the samples anyway, pass the `all_samples_required=False` option:

``` python
# will not raise an error if the log file has an "error" or "cancelled" status
for sample in read_eval_log_samples(log_file, all_samples_required=False):
    ...
```


### Attachments

Sample logs often include large pieces of content (e.g. images) that are duplicated in multiple places in the log file (input, message history, events, etc.). To keep the size of log files manageable, images and other large blocks of content are de-duplicated and stored as attachments.

When reading log files, you may want to resolve the attachments so you can get access to the underlying content. You can do this for an `EvalSample` using the `resolve_sample_attachments()` function:

``` python
from inspect_ai.log import resolve_sample_attachments

sample = resolve_sample_attachments(sample)
```

Note that the `read_eval_log()` and `read_eval_log_sample()` functions also take a `resolve_attachments` option if you want to resolve at the time of reading.

Note you will most typically *not* want to resolve attachments. The two cases that require attachment resolution for an `EvalSample` are:

1.  You want access to the base64 encoded images within the `input` and `messages` fields; or

2.  You are directly reading the `events` transcript, and want access to the underlying content (note that more than just images are de-duplicated in `events`, so anytime you are reading it you will likely want to resolve attachments).

{{< include _sample-preservation.md >}}

We've discussed how to manage retries for a single evaluation run interactively. For the case of running many evaluation tasks in batch and retrying those which failed, see the documentation on [Eval Sets](eval-sets.qmd)


## Amazon S3 {#sec-amazon-s3}

Storing evaluation logs on S3 provides a more permanent and secure store than using the local filesystem. While the `inspect eval` command has a `--log-dir` argument which accepts an S3 URL, the most convenient means of directing inspect to an S3 bucket is to add the `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` environment variable to the `.env` file (potentially alongside your S3 credentials). For example:

``` env
INSPECT_LOG_DIR=s3://my-s3-inspect-log-bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=eu-west-2
```

One thing to keep in mind if you are storing logs on S3 is that they will no longer be easily viewable using a local text editor. You will likely want to configure a [FUSE filesystem](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) so you can easily browse the S3 logs locally.


## Log File Name

By default, log files are named using the following convention:

```
{timestamp}_{task}_{id}
```

Where `timestamp` is the time the log was created; `task` is the name of the task the log corresponds to; and `id` is a unique task id. 

The `{timestamp}` part of the log file name is required to ensure that log files appear in sequential order in the filesystem. However, the rest of the filename can be customized using the `INSPECT_EVAL_LOG_FILE_PATTERN` environment variable, which can include any combination of `task`, `model`, and `id` fields. For example, to include the `model` in log file names:

```bash
export INSPECT_EVAL_LOG_FILE_PATTERN={task}_{model}_{id}
inspect eval ctf.py 
```

As with other log file oriented environment variables, you may find it convenient to define this in a `.env` file from the location where you run your evals.

## Log Commands {#sec-log-commands}

We've shown a number of Python functions that let you work with eval logs from code. However, you may be writing an orchestration or visualisation tool in another language (e.g. TypeScript) where its not particularly convenient to call the Python API. The Inspect CLI has a few commands intended to make it easier to work with Inspect logs from other languages:

| Command               | Description                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `inspect log list`    | List all logs in the log directory. |
| `inspect log dump`    | Print log file contents as JSON.    |
| `inspect log convert` | Convert between log file formats.   |
| `inspect log schema`  | Print JSON schema for log files.    |

### Listing Logs

You can use the `inspect log list` command to enumerate all of the logs for a given log directory. This command will utilise the `INSPECT_LOG_DIR` if it is set (alternatively you can specify a `--log-dir` directly). You'll likely also want to use the `--json` flag to get more granular and structured information on the log files. For example:

``` bash
$ inspect log list --json           # uses INSPECT_LOG_DIR
$ inspect log list --json --log-dir ./security_04-07-2024
```

You can also use the `--status` option to list only logs with a `success` or `error` status:

``` bash
$ inspect log list --json --status success
$ inspect log list --json --status error
```

You can use the `--retryable` option to list only logs that are [retryable](#eval-retries)

``` bash
$ inspect log list --json --retryable
```

### Reading Logs

The `inspect log list` command will return set of URIs to log files which will use a variety of protocols (e.g. `file://`, `s3://`, `gcs://`, etc.). You might be tempted to try to read these URIs directly, however you should always do so using the `inspect log dump` command for two reasons:

1.  As described above in [Log Format](#sec-log-format), log files may be stored in binary or text. the `inspect log dump` command will print any log file as plain text JSON no matter its underlying format.
2.  Log files can be located on remote storage systems (e.g. Amazon S3) that users have configured read/write credentials for within their Inspect environment, and you'll want to be sure to take advantage of these credentials.

For example, here we read a local log file and a log file on Amazon S3:

``` bash
$ inspect log dump file:///home/user/log/logfile.json
$ inspect log dump s3://my-evals-bucket/logfile.json
```

### Converting Logs {#converting-logs}

You can convert between the two underlying [log formats](#sec-log-format) using the `inspect log convert` command. The convert command takes a source path (with either a log file or a directory of log files) along with two required arguments that specify the conversion (`--to` and `--output-dir`). For example:

``` bash
$ inspect log convert source.json --to eval --output-dir log-output
```

Or for an entire directory:

``` bash
$ inspect log convert logs --to eval --output-dir logs-eval
```

Logs that are already in the target format are simply copied to the output directory. By default, log files in the target directory will not be overwritten, however you can add the `--overwrite` flag to force an overwrite.

Note that the output directory is always required to enforce the practice of not doing conversions that result in side-by-side log files that are identical save for their format.

### Log Schema

Log files are stored in JSON. You can get the JSON schema for the log file format with a call to `inspect log schema`:

``` bash
$ inspect log schema
```

#### NaN and Inf

Because evaluation logs contain lots of numerical data and calculations, it is possible that some `number` values will be `NaN` or `Inf`. These numeric values are supported natively by Python's JSON parser, however are not supported by the JSON parsers built in to browsers and Node JS.

To correctly read `Nan` and `Inf` values from eval logs in JavaScript, we recommend that you use the [JSON5 Parser](https://github.com/json5/json5). For other languages, `Nan` and `Inf` may be natively supported (if not, see these JSON 5 implementations for [other languages](https://github.com/json5/json5/wiki/In-the-Wild)).
