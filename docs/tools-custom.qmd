title: Custom Tools

## Overview

Inspect natively supports registering Python functions as tools and providing these tools to models that support them. Inspect also supports secure sandboxes for running abritrary code produced by models, flexible error handling, as well as dynamic tool definitions. 

We'll cover all of these features below, but we'll start with a very simple example to cover the basic mechanics of tool use.

## Defining Tools

{{< include _tools-basics.md >}}

## Tool Errors

Various errors can occur during tool execution, especially when interacting with the file system or network or when using [Sandbox Environments](sandboxing.qmd) to execute code in a container sandbox. As a tool writer you need to decide how you'd like to handle error conditions. A number of approaches are possible:

1.  Notify the model that an error occurred to see whether it can recover.

2.  Catch and handle the error internally (trying another code path, etc.).

3.  Allow the error to propagate, resulting in the current `Sample` failing with an error state.

There are no universally correct approaches as tool usage and semantics can vary widely—some rough guidelines are provided below.

### Default Handling {#default-handling}

If you do not explicitly handle errors, then Inspect provides some default error handling behaviour. Specifically, if any of the following errors are raised they will be handled and reported to the model:

-   `TimeoutError` — Occurs when a call to `subprocess()` or `sandbox().exec()` times out.

-   `PermissionError` — Occurs when there are inadequate permissions to read or write a file.

-   `UnicodeDecodeError` — Occurs when the output from executing a process or reading a file is binary rather than text.

-   `OutputLimitExceededError` - Occurs when one or both of the output streams from `sandbox().exec()` exceed 10 MiB or when attempting to read a file over 100 MiB in size.

-   `ToolError` — Special error thrown by tools to indicate they'd like to report an error to the model.

These are all errors that are *expected* (in fact the `SandboxEnvironment` interface documents them as such) and possibly recoverable by the model (try a different command, read a different file, etc.). Unexpected errors (e.g. a network error communicating with a remote service or container runtime) on the other hand are not automatically handled and result in the `Sample` failing with an error.

Many tools can simply rely on the default handling to provide reasonable behaviour around both expected and unexpected errors.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
When we say that the errors are reported directly to the model, this refers to the behaviour when using the default `generate()`. If on the other hand, you are have created custom scaffolding for an agent, you can intercept tool errors and apply additional filtering and logic.

### Explicit Handling

In some cases a tool can implement a recovery strategy for error conditions. For example, an HTTP request might fail due to transient network issues, and retrying the request (perhaps after a delay) may resolve the problem. Explicit error handling strategies are generally applied when there are *expected* errors that are not already handled by Inspect's [Default Handling](#default-handling).

Another type of explicit handling is re-raising an error to bypass Inspect's default handling. For example, here we catch at re-raise `TimeoutError` so that it fails the `Sample`:

``` python
try:
  result = await sandbox().exec(
    cmd=["decode", file], 
    timeout=timeout
  )
except TimeoutError:
  raise RuntimeError("Decode operation timed out.")
  
```

## Sandboxing

Tools may have a need to interact with a sandboxed environment (e.g. to provide models with the ability to execute arbitrary bash or python commands). The active sandbox environment can be obtained via the `sandbox()` function. For example:

``` python
from inspect_ai.tool import ToolError, tool
from inspect_ai.util import sandbox

@tool
def list_files():
    async def execute(dir: str):
        """List the files in a directory.

        Args:
            dir (str): Directory

        Returns:
            File listing of the directory
        """
        result = await sandbox().exec(["ls", dir])
        if result.success:
            return result.stdout
        else:
            raise ToolError(result.stderr)

    return execute
```

The following instance methods are available to tools that need to interact with a `SandboxEnvironment`:

See the documentation on [Sandbox Environments](sandboxing.qmd) for additional details.

## Tool Choice

By default models will use a tool if they think it's appropriate for the given task. You can override this behaviour using the `tool_choice` parameter of the `use_tools()` Solver. For example:

``` python
# let the model decide whether to use the tool
use_tools(addition(), tool_choice="auto")

# force the use of a tool
use_tools(addition(), tool_choice=ToolFunction(name="addition"))

# prevent use of tools
use_tools(addition(), tool_choice="none")
```

The last form (`tool_choice="none"`) would typically be used to turn off tool usage after an initial generation where the tool used. For example:

``` python
solver = [
  use_tools(addition(), tool_choice=ToolFunction(name="addition")),
  generate(),
  follow_up_prompt(),
  use_tools(tool_choice="none"),
  generate()
]
```

## Tool Descriptions {#sec-tool-descriptions}

Well crafted tools should include descriptions that provide models with the context required to use them correctly and productively. If you will be developing custom tools it's worth taking some time to learn how to provide good tool definitions. Here are some resources you may find helpful:

-   [Best Practices for Tool Definitions](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/tool-use#best-practices-for-tool-definitions)
-   [Function Calling with LLMs](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/function_calling)

In some cases you may want to change the default descriptions created by a tool author—for example you might want to provide better disambiguation between multiple similar tools that are used together. You also might have need to do this during development of tools (to explore what descriptions are most useful to models).

The `tool_with()` function enables you to take any tool and adapt its name and/or descriptions. For example:

``` python
from inspect_ai.tool import tool_with

my_add = tool_with(
  tool=add(), 
  name="my_add",
  description="a tool to add numbers", 
  parameters={
    "x": "the x argument",
    "y": "the y argument"
  })
```

You need not provide all of the parameters shown above, for example here are some examples where we modify just the main tool description or only a single parameter:

``` python
my_add = tool_with(add(), description="a tool to add numbers")
my_add = tool_with(add(), parameters={"x": "the x argument"})
```

Note that the `tool_with()` function returns a copy of the passed tool with modified descriptions (the passed tool retains its original descriptions).

## Dynamic Tools {#sec-dynamic-tools}

As described above, normally tools are defined using `@tool` decorators and documentation comments. It's also possible to create a tool dynamically from any function by creating a `ToolDef`. For example:

``` python
from inspect_ai.solver import use_tools
from inspect_ai.tool import ToolDef

async def addition(x: int, y: int):
    return x + y

add = ToolDef(
    tool=addition,
    name="add",
    description="A tool to add numbers", 
    parameters={
        "x": "the x argument",
        "y": "the y argument"
    })
)

use_tools([add])
```

This is effectively what happens under the hood when you use the `@tool` decorator. There is one critical requirement for functions that are bound to tools using `ToolDef`: type annotations must be provided in the function signature (e.g. `x: int, y: int`).

For Inspect APIs, `ToolDef` can generally be used anywhere that `Tool` can be used (`use_tools()`, setting `state.tools`, etc.). If you are using a 3rd party API that does not take `Tool` in its interface, use the `ToolDef.as_tool()` method to adapt it. For example:

``` python
from inspect_agents import my_agent
agent = my_agent(tools=[add.as_tool()])
```

If on the other hand you want to get the `ToolDef` for an existing tool (e.g. to discover its name, description, and parameters) you can just pass the `Tool` to the `ToolDef` constructor (including whatever overrides for `name`, etc. you want):

``` python
from inspect_ai.tool import ToolDef, bash
bash_def = ToolDef(bash())
```
