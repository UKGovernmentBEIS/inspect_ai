title: Model Context Protocol
---

## Overview

The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standard way to provide capabilities to LLMs. There are hundreds of [MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers) that provide tools for a myriad of purposes including web search, filesystem interaction, database access, git, and more.

Each MCP server provides a set of LLM tools. You can use all of the tools from a server or select a subset of tools. To use these tools in Inspect, you first define a connection to an MCP Server then pass the server on to Inspect functions that take `tools` as an argument.

### Example

For example, here we create a connection to a [Git MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/git), and then pass it to a `react()` agent used as a solver for a task:

``` python
from inspect_ai import task
from inspect_ai.agent import react
from inspect_ai.tool import mcp_server_stdio

@task
def git_task():
    git_server = mcp_server_stdio(
        command="python3", 
        args=["-m", "mcp_server_git", "--repository", "."]
    )

    return Task(
        dataset=[Sample(
            "What is the git status of the working directory?"
        )],
        solver=react(tools=[git_server])
    )
```

The Git MCP server provides various tools for interacting with Git (e.g. `git_status()`, `git_diff()`, `git_log()`, etc.). By passing the `git_server` instance to the agent we make these tools available to it. You can also filter the list of tools (which is covered below in [Tool Selection](#tool-selection)).

## MCP Servers

MCP servers can use a variety of transports. There are two transports built-in to the core implementation:

-   **Standard I/O (stdio).** The stdio transport enables communication to a local process through standard input and output streams.

-   **Server-Sent Events (sse).** SSE transport enables server-to-client streaming with HTTP POST requests for client-to-server communication, typically to a remote host.

In addition, the Inspect implementation of MCP adds another transport:

-   **Sandbox (sandbox)**. The sandbox transport enables communication to a process running in an Inspect sandbox through standard input and output streams.

You can use the following functions to create interfaces to the various types of servers:

|                        |                                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `mcp_server_stdio()`   | Stdio interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers that run locally.                 |
| `mcp_server_sse()`     | SSE interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers available via a URL endpoint.       |
| `mcp_server_sandbox()` | Sandbox interface to MCP server. Use this for MCP servers that run in an Inspect sandbox. |

We'll cover using stdio and sse based servers in the section below. Sandbox servers require some additional container configuration, and are covered separately in [Sandboxes](#sandboxes).

### Server Command

For stdio servers, you need to provide the command to start the server along with potentially some command line arguments and environment variables. For sse servers you'll generally provide a host name and headers with credentials.

Servers typically provide their documentation in the JSON format required by the `claude_desktop_config.json` file in Claude Desktop. For example, here is the documentation for configuring the [Google Maps](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/google-maps#npx) server:

``` json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-maps": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"
      ],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When using MCP servers with Inspect, you only need to provide the inner arguments. For example, to use the Google Maps server with Inspect:

``` python
maps_server = mcp_server_stdio(
    command="npx", 
    args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"],
    env={ "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY": "<YOUR_API_KEY>" }
)
```

#### Node.js Prerequisite

The `"command": "npx"` option indicates that this server was written using Node.js (other servers may be written in Python and use `"command": "python3"`). Using Node.js based MCP servers requires that you install Node.js (<https://nodejs.org/en/download>).
:::

### Server Tools

Each MCP server makes available a set of tools. For example, the Google Maps server includes [7 tools](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/google-maps#tools) (e.g. `maps_search_places()` , `maps_place_details()`, etc.). You can make these tools available to Inspect by passing the server interface alongside other standard `tools`. For example:

``` python
@task
def map_task():
    maps_server = mcp_server_stdio(
        command="npx", 
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-google-maps"]
    )

    return Task(
        dataset=[Sample(
            "Where can I find a good comic book store in London?"
        )],
        solver=react(tools=[maps_server])
    )
```

In this example we use all of the tool made available by the server. You can also select a subset of tools (this is covered below in [Tool Selection](#tool-selection)).

::: {.callout-note}
### ToolSource

The `MCPServer` interface is a `ToolSource`, which is a new interface for dynamically providing a set of tools. Inspect generation methods that take `Tool` or `ToolDef` now also take `ToolSource`. 

If you are creating your own agents or functions that take `tools` arguments, we recommend you do this same if you are going to be using MCP servers. For example:

``` python
@agent
def my_agent(tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolDef | ToolSource]):
    ...
```
:::

## Tool Selection {#tool-selection}

To narrow the list of tools made available from an MCP Server you can use the `mcp_tools()` function. For example, to make only the geocode oriented functions available from the Google Maps server:

``` python
return Task(
    ...,
    solver=react(tools=[
        mcp_tools(
            maps_server, 
            tools=["maps_geocode", "maps_reverse_geocode"]
        )
    ])
)
```

You can also use glob wildcards in the `tools` list:

``` python
return Task(
    ...,
    solver=react(tools=[
        mcp_tools(
            maps_server, 
            tools=["*_geocode"]
        )
    ])
)
```

## Connections

MCP Servers can be either stateless or stateful. Stateful servers may retain context in memory whereas stateless servers either have no state or operate on external state. For example the [Brave Search](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/brave-search) server is stateless (it just processes one search at a time) whereas the [Knowledge Graph Memory](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory) server is stateful (it maintains a knowledge graph in memory).

In the case that you using stateful servers, you will want to establish a longer running connection to the server so that it's state is maintained across calls. You can do this using the `mcp_connection()` context manager.

#### ReAct Agent

The `mcp_connection()` context manager is used **automatically** by the `react()` agent, with the server connection being maintained for the duration of the agent loop. 

For example, the following will establish a single connection to the memory server and preserve its state across calls:

``` python
memory_server = mcp_server_stdio(
    command="npx", 
    args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
)

return Task(
    ...,
    solver=react(tools=[memory_server])
)
```

#### Custom Agents

For general purpose custom agents, you will also likely want to use the `mcp_connection()` connect manager to preserve connection state throughout your tool use loop. For example, here is a web surfer agent that uses a web browser along with a memory server:

```` python
@agent
def web_surfer() -> Agent:
    async def execute(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        """Web research assistant."""
      
        # some general guidance for the agent
        state.messages.append(
            ChatMessageSystem(
                content="You are a tenacious web researcher that is "
                + "expert at using a web browser to answer questions. "
                + "Use the memory tools to track your research."
            )
        )

        # interface to memory server
        memory_server = mcp_server_stdio(
            command="npx", 
            args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
        )

        # run tool loop w/ then update & return state
        async with mcp_connection(memory_server):
            messages, state.output = await get_model().generate_loop(
                state.messages, tools=web_browser() + [memory_server]
            )
            state.messages.extend(messages)
            return state

    return execute
```
````

Note that the `mcp_connection()` function can take an arbitrary list of `tools` and will discover and connect to any MCP-based `ToolSource` in the list. So if your agent takes a `tools` parameter you can just forward it on. For example:

``` python
@agent
def my_agent(tools: Sequence[Tool | ToolDef | ToolSource]):
    async def execute(state: AgentState):
       async with mcp_connection(tools):
           # tool use loop
           ...
```

## Sandboxes {#sandboxes}

Sandbox servers are stdio servers than run inside a [sandbox](sandboxing.qmd) rather than alongside the Inspect evaluation scaffold. You will generally choose to use sandbox servers when the tools provided by the server need to interact with the host system in a secure fashion (e.g. git, filesystem, or code execution tools).

### Configuration

To run an MCP server inside a sandbox, you should create a `Dockerfile` that includes both the `inspect-tool-support` pip package as well as any MCP servers you want to run. The easiest way to do this is to derive from the standard `aisiuk/inspect-tool-support` Docker image.

For example, here we create a `Dockerfile` that enables us to use the [Filesystem MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem):

``` {.Dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"}
# base image
FROM aisiuk/inspect-tool-support

# nodejs (required by mcp server)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    && curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | bash - \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends nodejs \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# filesystem mcp server
RUN npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
```

Note that we install the `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem` package globally so it is available to sandbox users and can be run even when the container is disconnected from the Internet.

You are not required to inherit from the `aisiuk/inspect-tool-support` base image. If you want to use another base image please see **Custom Base Image** below for details on how to do this.

### Running the Server

Installing the package globally means we'll want to invoke it using its global executable name (rather than via `npx`). You can typically find this in the `"bin"` section of a server's `package.json` file. For example, here is where the Filesystem MCP Server [defines its global binary](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/blob/368e3b23ca08c629a500c63e9bbe1233012a1f9a/src/filesystem/package.json#L10-L12).

We can now use the `mcp_server_sandbox()` function to run the server as follows:

``` python
maps_server = mcp_server_sandbox(
    command="mcp-server-filesystem", 
    args=["/"]
)
```

This will look for the MCP server in the default sandbox (you can also specify an explicit `sandbox` option if it is located in another sandbox).
