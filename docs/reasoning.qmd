## Overview

Reasoning models like OpenAI o1 and o3, Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and DeepSeek's r1 have some additional options that can be used to tailor their behaviour. They also in some cases make available full or partial reasoning traces for the chains of thought that led to their response.

In this article we'll first cover the basics of [Reasoning Content](#reasoning-content) and [Reasoning Options](#reasoning-options), then cover the usage and options supported by various reasoning models.

## Reasoning Content {#reasoning-content}

Many reasoning models allow you to see their underlying chain of thought in a special "thinking" or reasoning block. While reasoning is presented in different ways depending on the model, in the Inspect API it is normalised into `ContentReasoning` blocks which are parallel to `ContentText`, `ContentImage`, etc.

Reasoning blocks are presented in their own region in both Inspect View and in terminal conversation views.

While reasoning content isn't made available in a standard fashion across models, Inspect does attempt to capture it using several heuristics, including responses that include a `reasoning` or `reasoning_content` field in the assistant message, assistant content that includes `<think></think>` tags, as well as using explicit APIs for models that support them (e.g. Claude 3.7).

In addition, some models (currently OpenAI and Anthropic) make available `reasoning_tokens` which will be added to the standard `ModelUsage` object returned along with output.

## Reasoning Options {#reasoning-options}

The following reasoning options are available from the CLI and within `GenerateConfig`:

| Option              | Description                                                                           | Default  | Models       |
|------------------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `reasoning_effort`  | Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models (`low`, `medium`, or `high`)      | `medium` | OpenAI o1/o3 |
| `reasoning_tokens`  | Maximum number of tokens to use for reasoning.                                        | (none)   | Claude 3.7   |
| `reasoning_history` | Include reasoning in message history sent to model (`none`, `all`, `last`, or `auto`) | `auto`   | All models   |

As you can see from above, models have different means of specifying the tokens to allocate for reasoning (`reasoning_effort` and `reasoning_tokens`). The two options don't map precisely into each other, so if you are doing an evaluation with multiple reasoning models you should specify both. For example:

``` python
 eval(
    task,
    model=["openai/o3-mini","anthropic/anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"],
    reasoning_effort="medium",
    reasoning_tokens=4096
 )
```

The `reasoning_history` option lets you control how much of the model's previous reasoning is presented in the message history sent to `generate()`. The default is `auto`, which uses a provider-specific recommended default (normally `all`). Use `last` to not let the reasoning overwhelm the context window.

## OpenAI o1/o3

OpenAI has several reasoning models available including the o1 and o3 series (`openai/o1`, `openai/o1-mini`, and `openai/o3-mini`). Learn more about the specific models available in the [OpenAI Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) documentation.

You can condition the amount of reasoning done via the [`reasoning_effort`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning#reasoning-effort) option, which can be set to `low`, `medium`, or `high` (the default is `medium` if not specified).

OpenAI models currently do not have provision for displaying reasoning content or replaying it to the model.

## Claude 3.7 Sonnet

Anthropic's Claude 3.7 Sonnet model includes optional support for [extended thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking). Unlike other reasoning models 3.7 Sonnet is a hybrid model that supports both normal and reasoning modes. This means that you need to explicitly request reasoning by specifying the `reasoning_tokens` option, for example:

``` bash
inspect eval math.py \
  --model anthropic/claude-3-7-sonnet-latest \
  --reasoning-tokens 4096
```

#### Tokens

The `max_tokens` for any given request is determined as follows:

1. If you only specify `reasoning_tokens`, then the `max_tokens` will be set to `4096 + reasoning_tokens` (as 4096 is the standard Inspect default for Anthropic max tokens).
2. If you explicitly specify a `max_tokens`, that value will be used as the max tokens without modification (so should accomodate sufficient space for both your `reasoning_tokens` and normal output).

Inspect will automatically use [response streaming](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/messages-streaming) whenever extended thinking is enabled to mitigate against networking issue that can occur for long running requests.


#### History

Note that Anthropic requests that all reasoning blocks and played back to the model in chat conversations (although they will only use the last reasoning block and will not bill for tokens on previous ones). Consquently, the `reasoning_history` option has no effect for Claude 3.7 models (it effectively always uses `last`).

#### Tools

When using tools, you should read Anthropic's documentation on [extended thinking with tool use](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#extended-thinking-with-tool-use). In short, thinking occurs on the first assistant turn and then the normal tool loop is run without additional thinking. Thinking is re-triggered when the tool loop is exited (i.e. a user message without a tool result is received).

## Google Flash Thinking

Google currently makes available a single experimental reasoning model ([Gemini Flash Thinking](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/flash-thinking/)) which you can access using the model name `google/gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp`.

There aren't currently options for reasoning effort or reasoning tokens. By default Gemini currently includes all reasoning in the model history and recommends that it all be included in subsequent requests in a conversation.

Inspect captures reasoning blocks from Gemini using the "Final Answer: " delimiter currently used by Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (the API has a separate field for \`thinking\` but it is not currently used in responses).

## DeepSeek-R1

[DeepSeek-R1](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) is an open-weights reasoning model from DeepSeek. It is generally available either in its original form or as a distillation of R1 based on another open weights model (e.g. Qwen or Llama-based models).

DeepSeek models can be accessed directly using their [OpenAI interface](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/). Further, a number of model hosting providers supported by Inspect make DeepSeek available, for example:

| Provider                                 | Model                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [Together AI](providers.qmd#together-ai) | `together/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` ([docs](https://www.together.ai/models/deepseek-r1)) |
| [Groq](providers.qmd#groq)               | `groq/deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b` ([docs](https://console.groq.com/docs/reasoning))  |
| [Ollama](providers.qmd#ollama)           | `ollama/deepseek-r1:<tag>` ([docs](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1))             |

There isn't currently a way to customise the `reasoning_effort` of DeepSeek models, although they have indicated that this will be [available soon](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/guides/reasoning_model).

Reasoning content from DeepSeek models is captured using either the `reasoning_content` field made available by the hosted DeepSeek API or the `<think>` tags used by various hosting providers.
