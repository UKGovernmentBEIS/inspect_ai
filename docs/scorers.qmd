## Overview

Scorers evaluate whether solvers were successful in finding the right `output` for the `target` defined in the dataset, and in what measure. Scorers generally take one of the following forms:

1.  Extracting a specific answer out of a model's completion output using a variety of heuristics.

2.  Applying a text similarity algorithm to see if the model's completion is close to what is set out in the `target`.

3.  Using another model to assess whether the model's completion satisfies a description of the ideal answer in `target`.

4.  Using another rubric entirely (e.g. did the model produce a valid version of a file format, etc.)

Scorers also define one or more metrics which are used to aggregate scores (e.g. `accuracy()` which computes what percentage of scores are correct, or `mean()` which provides an average for scores that exist on a continuum).

## Built-In Scorers

Inspect includes some simple text matching scorers as well as a couple of model graded scorers. Built in scorers can be imported from the `inspect_ai.scorer` module. Below is a summary of these scorers. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the **Go to Definition** command in your source editor.

-   `includes()`

    Determine whether the `target` from the `Sample` appears anywhere inside the model output. Can be case sensitive or insensitive (defaults to the latter).

-   `match()`

    Determine whether the `target` from the `Sample` appears at the beginning or end of model output (defaults to looking at the end). Has options for ignoring case, white-space, and punctuation (all are ignored by default).

-   `pattern()`

    Extract the answer from model output using a regular expression.

-   `answer()`

    Scorer for model output that preceded answers with "ANSWER: ". Can extract letters, words, or the remainder of the line.

-   `exact()`

    Scorer which will normalize the text of the answer and target(s) and perform an exact matching comparison of the text. This scorer will return `CORRECT` when the answer is an exact match to one or more targets.

-   `f1()`

    Scorer which computes the `F1` score for the answer (which balances recall precision by taking the harmonic mean between recall and precision).

-   `model_graded_qa()`

    Have another model assess whether the model output is a correct answer based on the grading guidance contained in `target`. Has a built-in template that can be customised.

-   `model_graded_fact()`

    Have another model assess whether the model output contains a fact that is set out in `target`. This is a more narrow assessment than `model_graded_qa()`, and is used when model output is too complex to be assessed using a simple `match()` or `pattern()` scorer.

-   `choices()`

    Specialised scorer that is used with the `multiple_choice()` solver.

Scorers provide one or more built-in metrics (each of the scorers above provides `accuracy` and `stderr` as a metric). You can also provide your own custom metrics in `Task` definitions. For example:

``` python
Task(
    dataset=dataset,
    solver=[
        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),
        multiple_choice()
    ],
    scorer=match(),
    metrics=[custom_metric()]
)
```

::: {#stderr-note .callout-note}
The current development version of Inspect replaces the use of the `bootstrap_std` metric with `stderr` for the built in scorers enumerated above.

Since eval scores are means of numbers having finite variance, we can compute standard errors using the Central Limit Theorem rather than bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is generally useful in contexts with more complex structure or non-mean summary statistics (e.g. quantiles). You will notice that the bootstrap numbers will come in quite close to the analytic numbers, since they are estimating the same thing.

A common misunderstanding is that "t-tests require the underlying data to be normally distributed". This is only true for small-sample problems; for large sample problems (say 30 or more questions), you just need finite variance in the underlying data and the CLT guarantees a normally distributed mean value.
:::

## Model Graded

Model graded scorers are well suited to assessing open ended answers as well as factual answers that are embedded in a longer narrative. The built-in model graded scorers can be customised in several ways—you can also create entirely new model scorers (see the model graded example below for a starting point).

Here is the declaration for the `model_graded_qa()` function:

``` python
@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])
def model_graded_qa(
    template: str | None = None,
    instructions: str | None = None,
    grade_pattern: str | None = None,
    include_history: bool | Callable[[TaskState], str] = False,
    partial_credit: bool = False,
    model: list[str | Model] | str | Model | None = None,
) -> Scorer:
    ...
```

The default model graded QA scorer is tuned to grade answers to open ended questions. The default `template` and `instructions` ask the model to produce a grade in the format `GRADE: C` or `GRADE: I`, and this grade is extracted using the default `grade_pattern` regular expression. The grading is by default done with the model currently being evaluated. There are a few ways you can customise the default behaviour:

1.  Provide alternate `instructions`—the default instructions ass the model to use chain of thought reasoning and provide grades in the format `GRADE: C` or `GRADE: I`. Note that if you provide instructions that ask the model to format grades in a different way, you will also want to customise the `grade_pattern`.
2.  Specify `include_history = True` to include the full chat history in the presented question (by default only the original sample input is presented). You may optionally instead pass a function that enables customising the presentation of the chat history.
3.  Specify `partial_credit = True` to prompt the model to assign partial credit to answers that are not entirely right but come close (metrics by default convert this to a value of 0.5). Note that this parameter is only valid when using the default `instructions`.
4.  Specify an alternate `model` to perform the grading (e.g. a more powerful model or a model fine tuned for grading).
5.  Specify a different `template`—note that templates are passed these variables: `question`, `criterion`, `answer`, and `instructions.`

The `model_graded_fact()` scorer works identically to `model_graded_qa()`, and simply provides an alternate `template` oriented around judging whether a fact is included in the model output.

If you want to understand how the default templates for `model_graded_qa()` and `model_graded_fact()` work, see their [source code](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/src/inspect_ai/scorer/_model.py).

### Multiple Models

The built-in model graded scorers also support using multiple grader models (whereby the final grade is chosen by majority vote). For example, here we specify that 3 models should be used for grading:

``` python
model_graded_qa(
    model = [
        "google/gemini-1.0-pro",
        "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229" 
        "together/meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf",
    ]
)
```

The implementation of multiple grader models takes advantage of the `multi_scorer()` and `majority_vote()` functions, both of which can be used in your own scorers (as described in the [Multiple Scorers](#sec-multiple-scorers) section below).

## Custom Scorers

Custom scorers are functions that take a `TaskState` and `Target`, and yield a `Score`.

``` python
async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):
     # Compare state / model output with target
     # to yield a score
     return Score(value=...)
```

First we'll talk about the core `Score` and `Value` objects, then provide some examples of custom scorers to make things more concrete.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Note that `score()` above is declared as an `async` function. When creating custom scorers, it's critical that you understand Inspect's concurrency model. More specifically, if your scorer is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review [Parallelism](parallelism.qmd#sec-parallel-solvers-and-scorers) before proceeding.
:::

### Score

The components of `Score` include:

| Field         | Type            | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `value`       | `Value`         | Value assigned to the sample (e.g. "C" or "I", or a raw numeric value).         |
| `answer`      | `str`           | Text extracted from model output for comparison (optional).                     |
| `explanation` | `str`           | Explanation of score, e.g. full model output or grader model output (optional). |
| `metadata`    | `dict[str,Any]` | Additional metadata about the score to record in the log file (optional).       |

: {tbl-colwidths=\[20,20,60\]}

For example, the following are all valid `Score` objects:

``` python
Score(value="C")
Score(value="I")
Score(value=0.6)
Score(
    value="C" if extracted == target.text else "I", 
    answer=extracted, 
    explanation=state.output.completion
)
```

If you are extracting an answer from within a completion (e.g. looking for text using a regex pattern, looking at the beginning or end of the completion, etc.) you should strive to *always* return an `answer` as part of your `Score`, as this makes it much easier to understand the details of scoring when viewing the eval log file.

### Value

`Value` is union over the main scalar types as well as a `list` or `dict` of the same types:

``` python
Value = Union[
    str | int | float | bool,
    list[str | int | float | bool],
    dict[str, str | int | float | bool],
]
```

The vast majority of scorers will use `str` (e.g. for correct/incorrect via "C" and "I") or `float` (the other types are there to meet more complex scenarios). One thing to keep in mind is that whatever `Value` type you use in a scorer must be supported by the metrics declared for the scorer (more on this below).

Next, we'll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in scorers as a jumping off point for implementing your own scorers. If you are working on custom scorers, you should also review the [Scorer Workflow](#sec-scorer-workflow) section below for tips on optimising your development process.

### Example: Includes

Here is the source code for the built-in `includes()` scorer:

``` python
@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])   # <1>
def includes(ignore_case: bool = True):

    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):   # <2>

        # check for correct
        answer = state.output.completion
        target = target.text   # <3>
        if ignore_case:
            correct = answer.lower().rfind(target.lower()) != -1
        else:
            correct = answer.rfind(target) != -1

        # return score
        return Score(
            value = CORRECT if correct else INCORRECT,    # <4>
            answer=answer  # <5>
        )

    return score
```

1.  The function applies the `@scorer` decorator and registers two metrics for use with the scorer.
2.  The `score()` function is declared as `async`. This is so that it can participate in Inspect's optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this scorer doesn't call a model but others will).
3.  We make use of the `text` property on the `Target`. This is a convenience property to get a simple text value out of the `Target` (as targets can technically be a list of strings).
4.  We use the special constants `CORRECT` and `INCORRECT` for the score value (as the `accuracy()`, `stderr()`, and `bootstrap_std()` metrics know how to convert these special constants to float values (1.0 and 0.0 respectively).
5.  We provide the full model completion as the answer for the score (`answer` is optional, but highly recommended as it is often useful to refer to during evaluation development).

### Example: Model Grading

Here's a somewhat simplified version of the code for the `model_graded_qa()` scorer:

``` python

@scorer(metrics=[accuracy(), stderr()])
def model_graded_qa(
    template: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_TEMPLATE,
    instructions: str = DEFAULT_MODEL_GRADED_QA_INSTRUCTIONS,
    grade_pattern: str = DEFAULT_GRADE_PATTERN,
    model: str | Model | None = None,
) -> Scorer:
   
    # resolve grading template and instructions, 
    # (as they could be file paths or URLs)
    template = resource(template)
    instructions = resource(instructions)

    # resolve model
    grader_model = get_model(model)

    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target) -> Score:
        # format the model grading template
        score_prompt = template.format(
            question=state.input_text,
            answer=state.output.completion,
            criterion=target.text,
            instructions=instructions,
        )

        # query the model for the score
        result = await grader_model.generate(score_prompt)

        # extract the grade
        match = re.search(grade_pattern, result.completion)
        if match:
            return Score(
                value=match.group(1),
                answer=match.group(0),
                explanation=result.completion,
            )
        else:
            return Score(
                value=INCORRECT,
                explanation="Grade not found in model output: "
                + f"{result.completion}",
            )

    return score
```

Note that the call to `model_grader.generate()` is done with `await`—this is critical to ensure that the scorer participates correctly in the scheduling of generation work.

Note also we use the `input_text` property of the `TaskState` to access a string version of the original user input to substitute it into the grading template. Using the `input_text` has two benefits: (1) It is guaranteed to cover the original input from the dataset (rather than a transformed prompt in `messages`); and (2) It normalises the input to a string (as it could have been a message list).

## Multiple Scorers {#sec-multiple-scorers}

There are several ways to use multiple scorers in an evaluation:

1.  You can provide a list of scorers in a `Task` definition (this is the best option when scorers are entirely independent)
2.  You can yield multiple scores from a `Scorer` (this is the best option when scores share code and/or expensive computations).
3.  You can use multiple scorers and then aggregate them into a single scorer (e.g. majority voting).

### List of Scorers

`Task` definitions can specify multiple scorers. For example, the below task will use two different models to grade the results, storing two scores with each sample, one for each of the two models:

``` python
Task(
    dataset=dataset,
    solver=[
        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),
        generate()
    ],
    scorer=[
        model_graded_qa(model="openai/gpt-4"), 
        model_graded_qa(model="google/gemini-1.5-pro")
    ],
)
```

This is useful when there is more than one way to score a result and you would like preserve the individual score values with each sample (versus reducing the multiple scores to a single value).

### Scorer with Multiple Values

You may also create a scorer which yields multiple scores. This is useful when the scores use data that is shared or expensive to compute. For example:

``` python
@scorer(
    metrics={  # <1>
        "a_count": [mean(), stderr()],  # <1>
        "e_count": [mean(), stderr()]   # <1>
    } # <1>
)
def letter_count():
    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):
        answer = state.output.completion
        a_count = answer.count("a")
        e_count = answer.count("e")
        return Score(  # <2>
            value={"a_count": a_count, "e_count": e_count},  # <2>
            answer=answer  # <2>
        ) # <2>

    return score

task = Task(
    dataset=[Sample(input="Tell me a story."],
    scorer=letter_count()
)
```

1.  The metrics for this scorer are a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name).
2.  The score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the `@scorer` decorator.

The above example will produce two scores, `a_count` and `e_count`, each of which will have metrics for `mean` and `stderr`.

### Scorer with Complex Metrics 

Sometime, it is useful for a scorer to compute multiple values (returning a dictionary as the score value) and to have metrics computed both for each key in the score dictionary, but also for the dictionary as a whole. For example:


``` python
@scorer(
    metrics=[{  # <1>
        "a_count": [mean(), stderr()],  # <1>
        "e_count": [mean(), stderr()]   # <1>
    }, total_count()] # <1>
)
def letter_count():
    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):
        answer = state.output.completion
        a_count = answer.count("a")
        e_count = answer.count("e")
        return Score(  # <2>
            value={"a_count": a_count, "e_count": e_count},  # <2>
            answer=answer  # <2>
        ) # <2>

    return score

@metric
def total_count() -> Metric:
    def metric(scores: list[Score]) -> int | float:
        total = 0.0
        for score in scores:
            total = score.value["a_count"] # <3>
                + score.value["e_count"]   # <3>
        return total
    return metric

task = Task(
    dataset=[Sample(input="Tell me a story."],
    scorer=letter_count()
)
```
1.  The metrics for this scorer are a list, one element is a dictionary—this defines metrics to be applied to scores (by name), the other element is a Metric which will receive the entire score dictionary.
2.  The score value itself is a dictionary—the keys corresponding to the keys defined in the metrics on the `@scorer` decorator.
3.  The `total_count` metric will compute a metric based upon the entire score dictionary (since it isn't being mapped onto the dictionary by key) 


### Reducing Multiple Scores

It's possible to use multiple scorers in parallel, then reduce their output into a final overall score. This is done using the `multi_scorer()` function. For example, this is roughly how the built in model graders use multiple models for grading:

``` python
multi_scorer(
    scorers = [model_graded_qa(model=model) for model in models],
    reducer = "mode"
)
```

Use of `multi_scorer()` requires both a list of scorers as well as a *reducer* which determines how a list of scores will be turned into a single score. In this case we use the "mode" reducer which returns the score that appeared most frequently in the answers.


### Sandbox Access

If your Solver is an [Agent](agents.qmd) with tool use, you might want to inspect the contents of the tool sandbox to score the task.

The contents of the sandbox for the Sample are available to the scorer; simply call `await sandbox().read_file()` (or `.exec()`).

For example:


```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task
from inspect_ai.dataset import Sample
from inspect_ai.scorer import Score, Target, accuracy, scorer
from inspect_ai.solver import Plan, TaskState, generate, use_tools
from inspect_ai.tool import bash
from inspect_ai.util import sandbox


@scorer(metrics=[accuracy()])
def check_file_exists():
    async def score(state: TaskState, target: Target):
        try:
            _ = await sandbox().read_file(target.text)
            exists = True
        except FileNotFoundError:
            exists = False
        return Score(value=1 if exists else 0)

    return score


@task
def challenge() -> Task:
    return Task(
        dataset=[
            Sample(
                input="Create a file called hello-world.txt",
                target="hello-world.txt",
            )
        ],
        solver=[use_tools([bash()]), generate()],
        sandbox="local",
        scorer=check_file_exists(),
    )

```



## Scoring Metrics

Each scorer provides one or more built-in metrics (typically `accuracy` and `stderr`) corresponding to the most typically useful metrics for that scorer.

You can override scorer's built-in metrics by passing an alternate list of `metrics` to the `Task`. For example:

``` python
Task(
    dataset=dataset,
    solver=[
        system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),
        multiple_choice()
    ],
    scorer=choice(),
    metrics=[custom_metric()]
)
```

If you still want to compute the built-in metrics, we re-specify them along with the custom metrics:

```python
metrics=[accuracy(), stderr(), custom_metric()]
```

### Built-In Metrics

Inspect includes some simple built in metrics for calculating accuracy, mean, etc. Built in metrics can be imported from the `inspect_ai.scorer` module. Below is a summary of these metrics. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the **Go to Definition** command in your source editor.

-   `accuracy()`

    Compute proportion of total answers which are correct. For correct/incorrect scores assigned 1 or 0, can optionally assign 0.5 for partially correct answers.

-   `mean()`

    Mean of all scores.

-   `var()`

    Variance over all scores.

-   `std()`

    Sample standard deviation of all scores.

-   `stderr()`

    Standard error of the mean.

-   `bootstrap_std()`

    Standard deviation of a bootstrapped estimate of the mean. 1000 samples are taken by default (modify this using the `num_samples` option).

### Custom Metrics

You can also add your own metrics with `@metric` decorated functions. For example, here is the implementation of the variance metric:

``` python
import numpy as np

from inspect_ai.scorer import Metric, Score, metric

@metric
def var() -> Metric:
    """Compute variance over all scores."""

    def metric(scores: list[Score]) -> float:
        return np.var([score.as_float() for score in scores]).item()

    return metric
```

Note that the `Score` class contains a `Value` that is a union over several scalar and collection types. As a convenience, `Score` includes a set of accessor methods to treat the value as a simpler form (e.g. above we use the `score.as_float()` accessor).

## Reducing Epochs {#sec-reducing-epochs}

If a task is run over more than one `epoch`, multiple scores will be generated for each sample. These scores are then *reduced* to a single score representing the score for the sample across all the epochs. 

By default, this is done by taking the mean of all sample scores, but you may specify other strategies for reducing the samples by passing an `Epochs`, which includes both a count and one or more reducers to combine sample scores with. For example:

``` python
@task
def gpqa():
    return Task(
        dataset=read_gpqa_dataset("gpqa_main.csv"),
        solver=[
            system_message(SYSTEM_MESSAGE),
            multiple_choice(),
        ],
        scorer=choice(),
        epochs=Epochs(5, "mode"),
    )
```

You may also specify more than one reducer which will compute metrics using each of the reducers. For example:

``` python
@task
def gpqa():
    return Task(
        ...
        epochs=Epochs(5, ["at_least_2", "at_least_5"]),
    )
```

### Built-in Reducers

Inspect includes several built in reducers which are summarised below.

| Reducer                  | Description                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| mean                  | Reduce to the average of all scores.                                                                                 |
| median               | Reduce to the median of all scores                                                                                   |
| mode             | Reduce to the most common score.                                                             |
| max              | Reduce to the maximum of all scores.                                                            |
| pass_at_{k}  | Probability of at least 1 correct sample given `k` epochs (<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.03374>) |
| at_least_{k} | `1` if at least `k` samples are correct, else `0`. |

: {tbl-colwidths="\[30,70\]"}


:::{.callout-note}

The built in reducers will compute a reduced `value` for the score and populate the fields `answer` and `explanation` only if their value is equal across all epochs. The `metadata` field will always be reduced to the value of `metadata` in the first epoch. If your custom metrics function needs differing behavior for reducing fields, you should also implement your own custom reducer and merge or preserve fields in some way.

:::

### Custom Reducers

You can also add your own reducer with `@score_reducer` decorated functions. Here’s a somewhat simplified version of the code for the `mean` reducer:

``` python
import statistics

from inspect_ai.scorer import Score, ScoreReducer, score_reducer

@score_reducer(name="mean")

## Workflow {#sec-scorer-workflow}

### Score Command

By default, model output in evaluations is automatically scored. However, you can separate generation and scoring by using the `--no-score` option. For example:

``` bash
inspect eval popularity.py --model openai/gpt-4 --no-score
```

You can score an evaluation previously run this way using the `inspect score` command:

``` bash
# score last eval
inspect score popularity.py

# score specific log file
inspect score popularity.py ./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6.json
```

::: callout-tip
Using a distinct scoring step is particularly useful during scorer development, as it bypasses the entire generation phase, saving lots of time and inference costs.

### Log Overwriting

By default, `inspect score` overwrites the file it scores. If don't want to overwrite target files, pass the `--no-overwrite` flag:

``` bash
inspect score popularity.py --no-overwrite
```

When specifying `--no-overwrite`, a `-scored` suffix will be added to the original log file name:

``` bash
./logs/2024-02-23_task_gpt-4_TUhnCn473c6-scored.json
```

Note that the `--no-overwrite` flag does not apply to log files that already have the `-scored` suffix—those files are always overwritten by `inspect score`. If you plan on scoring multiple times and you want to save each scoring output, you will want to copy the log to another location before re-scoring.

### Python API

If you are exploring the performance of different scorers, you might find it more useful to call the `score()` function using varying scorers or scorer options. For example:

``` python
log = eval(popularity, model="openai/gpt-4")[0]

grader_models = [
    "openai/gpt-4",
    "anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229",
    "google/gemini-1.0-pro",
    "mistral/mistral-large-latest"
]

scoring_logs = [score(log, model_graded_qa(model=model)) 
                for model in grader_models]

plot_results(scoring_logs)
```
