title: Extensions 
---

## Overview

There are several ways to extend Inspect to integrate with systems not directly supported by the core package. These include:

1.  Model APIs (model hosting services, local inference engines, etc.)

2.  Sandboxes (local or cloud container runtimes)

3.  Approvers (approve, modify, or reject tool calls)

4.  Storage Systems (for datasets, prompts, and evaluation logs)

For each of these, you can create an extension within a Python package, and then use it without any special registration with Inspect (this is done via [setuptools entry points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html)).

## Model APIs {#sec-model-api-extensions}

You can add a model provider by deriving a new class from `ModelAPI` and then creating a function decorated by `@modelapi` that returns the class. These are typically implemented in separate files (for reasons described below):

``` {.python filename="custom.py"}
class CustomModelAPI(ModelAPI):
    def __init__(
        self, 
        model_name: str,
        base_url: str | None = None,
        api_key: str | None = None,
        api_key_vars: list[str] = [],
        config: GenerateConfig = GenerateConfig(),
        **model_args: Any
    ) -> None:
        super().__init__(model_name, base_url, api_key, api_key_vars, config)
  
    async def generate(
        self,
        input: list[ChatMessage],
        tools: list[ToolInfo],
        tool_choice: ToolChoice,
        config: GenerateConfig,
    ) -> ModelOutput:
        ...
```

``` {.python filename="providers.py"}
@modelapi(name="custom")
def custom():
    from .custom import CustomModelAPI

    return CustomModelAPI
```

The layer of indirection (creating a function that returns a ModelAPI class) is done so that you can separate the registration of models from the importing of libraries they require (important for limiting dependencies). You can see this used within Inspect to make all model package dependencies optional [here](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/src/inspect_ai/model/_providers/providers.py). With this scheme, pacakges required to interace with models (e.g. `openai`, `anthropic`, `vllm`, etc.) are only imported when their model API type is actually used.

The `__init__()` method *must* call the `super().__init__()` method, and typically instantiates the model client library.

The `__init__()` method receive a `**model_args` parameter that will carry any custom `model_args` (or `-M` and `--model-config` arguments from the CLI) specified by the user. You can then pass these on to the appropriate place in your model initialisation code (for example, here is what many of the built-in providers do with `model_args` passed to them: <https://inspect.ai-safety-institute.org.uk/models.html#model-args>).

The `generate()` method handles interacting with the model, converting inspect messages, tools, and config into model native data structures. Note that the generate method may optionally return a `tuple[ModelOutput,ModelCall]` in order to record the raw request and response to the model within the sample transcript.

In addition, there are some optional properties you can override to specify various behaviours and constraints (default max tokens and connections, identifying rate limit errors, whether to collapse consecutive user and/or assistant messages, etc.). See the [ModelAPI](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/src/inspect_ai/model/_model.py) source code for further documentation on these properties.

See the implementation of the [built-in model providers](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/tree/main/src/inspect_ai/model/_providers) for additional insight on building a custom provider.

### Model Registration

If you are publishing a custom model API within a Python package, you should register an `inspect_ai` [setuptools entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html). This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a model name that uses your provider.

For example, if your package was named `evaltools` and your model provider was exported from a source file named `_registry.py` at the root of your package, you would register it like this in `pyproject.toml`:

::: {.panel-tabset group="entry-points"}
## Setuptools

``` toml
[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```

## Poetry

``` toml
[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```
:::

### Model Usage

Once you've created the class, decorated it with `@modelapi` as shown above, and registered it, then you can use it as follows:

``` bash
inspect eval ctf.py --model custom/my-model
```

Where `my-model` is the name of some model supported by your provider (this will be passed to `__init()__` in the `model_name` argument).

You can also reference it from within Python calls to `get_model()` or `eval()`:

``` python
# get a model instance
model = get_model("custom/my-model")

# run an eval with the model
eval(math, model = "custom/my-model")
```

## Sandboxes {#sec-sandbox-environment-extensions}

[Sandbox Environments](agents.qmd#sec-sandbox-environments) provide a mechanism for sandboxing execution of tool code as well as providing more sophisticated infrastructure (e.g. creating network hosts for a cybersecurity eval). Inspect comes with two sandbox environments built in:

| Environment Type | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `local` | Run `sandbox()` methods in the same file system as the running evaluation (should *only be used* if you are already running your evaluation in another sandbox). |
| `docker` | Run `sandbox()` methods within a Docker container |

To create a custom sandbox environment, derive a class from `SandboxEnvironment`, implement the required static and instance methods, and add the `@sandboxenv` decorator to it.

The static class methods control the lifecycle of containers and other computing resources associated with the `SandboxEnvironment`:

``` {.python filename="podman.py"}
class PodmanSandboxEnvironment(SandboxEnvironment):

    @classmethod
    def config_files(cls) -> list[str]:
        ...

    @classmethod
    async def task_init(
        cls, task_name: str, config: str | None
    ) -> None:
        ...

    @classmethod
    async def sample_init(
        cls, 
        task_name: str, 
        config: str | None, 
        metadata: dict[str, str]
    ) -> dict[str, SandboxEnvironment]:
        ...

    @classmethod
    async def sample_cleanup(
        cls,
        task_name: str,
        config: str | None,
        environments: dict[str, SandboxEnvironment],
        interrupted: bool,
    ) -> None:
        ...

    @classmethod
    async def task_cleanup(
        cls, task_name: str, config: str | None, cleanup: bool
    ) -> None:
       ...

    @classmethod
    async def cli_cleanup(cls, id: str | None) -> None:
        ...

    # (instance methods shown below)
```

``` {.python filename="providers.py"}
def podman():
    from .podman import PodmanSandboxEnvironment

    return PodmanSandboxEnvironment
```

The layer of indirection (creating a function that returns a SandboxEnvironment class) is done so that you can separate the registration of sandboxes from the importing of libraries they require (important for limiting dependencies).

The class methods take care of various stages of initialisation, setup, and teardown:

| Method | Lifecycle | Purpose |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `config_files()` | Called once to determine the names of 'default' config files for this provider (e.g. 'compose.yaml'). |  |
| `task_init()` | Called once for each unique sandbox environment config before executing the tasks in an `eval()` run. | Expensive initialisation operations (e.g. pulling or building images) |
| `sample_init()` | Called at the beginning of each `Sample`. | Create `SandboxEnvironment` instances for the sample. |
| `sample_cleanup()` | Called at the end of each `Sample` | Cleanup `SandboxEnvironment` instances for the sample. |
| `task_cleanup()` | Called once for each unique sandbox environment config after executing the tasks in an `eval()` run. | Last chance handler for any resources not yet cleaned up (see also discussion below). |
| `cli_cleanup()` | Called via `inspect sandbox cleanup` | CLI invoked manual cleanup of resources created by this `SandboxEnvironment`. |

In the case of parallel execution of a group of tasks within the same working directory, the `task_init()` and `task_cleanup()` functions will be called once for each unique sandbox environment configuration (e.g. Docker Compose file). This is a performance optimisation derived from the fact that initialisation and cleanup are shared for tasks with identical configurations.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The "default" `SandboxEnvironment` i.e. that named "default" or marked as default in some other provider-specific way, **must** be the first key/value in the dictionary returned from `sample_init()`.
:::

The `task_cleanup()` has a number of important functions:

1.  There may be global resources that are not tied to samples that need to be cleaned up.
2.  It's possible that `sample_cleanup()` will be interrupted (e.g. via a Ctrl+C) during execution. In that case its resources are still not cleaned up.
3.  The `sample_cleanup()` function might be long running, and in the case of error or interruption you want to provide explicit user feedback on the cleanup in the console (which isn't possible when cleanup is run "inline" with samples). An `interrupted` flag is passed to `sample_cleanup()` which allows for varying behaviour for this scenario.
4.  Cleanup may be disabled (e.g. when the user passes `--no-sandbox-cleanup`) in which case it should print container IDs and instructions for cleaning up after the containers are no longer needed.

To implement `task_cleanup()` properly, you'll likely need to track running environments using a per-coroutine `ContextVar`. The `DockerSandboxEnvironment` provides an example of this. Note that the `cleanup` argument passed to `task_cleanup()` indicates whether to actually clean up (it would be `False` if `--no-sandbox-cleanup` was passed to `inspect eval`). In this case you might want to print a list of the resources that were not cleaned up and provide directions on how to clean them up manually.

The `cli_cleanup()` function is a global cleanup handler that should be able to do the following:

1.  Cleanup *all* environments created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. `inspect sandbox cleanup docker` at the CLI).
2.  Cleanup a single environment created by this provider (corresponds to e.g. `inspect sandbox cleanup docker <id>` at the CLI).

The `task_cleanup()` function will typically print out the information required to invoke `cli_cleanup()` when it is invoked with `cleanup = False`. Try invoking the `DockerSandboxEnvironment` with `--no-sandbox-cleanup` to see an example.

The `SandboxEnvironment` instance methods provide access to process execution and file input/output within the environment.

{{< include _sandboxenv-interface.md >}}

The best way to learn about writing sandbox environments is to look at the source code for the built in environments, [LocalSandboxEnvironment](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/src/inspect_ai/util/_sandbox/local.py) and [DockerSandboxEnvironment](https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai/blob/main/src/inspect_ai/util/_sandbox/docker/docker.py).

### Environment Registration

You should build your custom sandbox environment within a Python package, and then register an `inspect_ai` [setuptools entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html). This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve a sandbox environment that uses your provider.

For example, if your package was named `inspect_package` and your sandbox environment provider was exported from a source file named `_registry.py` at the root of your package, you would register it like this in `pyproject.toml`:

::: {.panel-tabset group="entry-points"}
## Setuptools

``` toml
[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```

## Poetry

``` toml
[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```
:::

### Environment Usage

Once the package is installed, you can refer to the custom sandbox environment the same way you'd refer to a built in sandbox environment. For example:

``` python
Task(
    ...,
    sandbox="podman"
)
```

Sandbox environments can be invoked with an optional configuration parameter, which is passed as the `config` argument to the `startup()` and `setup()` methods. In Python this is done with a tuple

``` python
Task(
    ...,
    sandbox=("podman","config.yaml")
)
```

## Approvers {#sec-extensions-approvers}

[Approvers](approval.qmd) enable you to create fine-grained policies for approving tool calls made by models. For example, the following are all supported:

1.  All tool calls are approved by a human operator.
2.  Select tool calls are approved by a human operator (the rest being executed without approval).
3.  Custom approvers that decide to either approve, reject, or escalate to another approver.

Approvers can be implemented in Python packages and the referred to by package and name from approval policy config files. For example, here is a simple custom approver that just reflects back a decision passed to it at creation time:

```{.python filename="approvers.py"}
@approver
def auto_approver(decision: ApprovalDecision = "approve") -> Approver:
    
    async def approve(
        message: str,
        call: ToolCall,
        view: ToolCallView,
        state: TaskState | None = None,
    ) -> Approval:
        return Approval(
            decision=decision, 
            explanation="Automatic decision."
        )

    return approve
```

### Approver Registration

If you are publishing an approver within a Python package, you should register an `inspect_ai` [setuptools entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html). This will ensure that inspect loads your extension before it attempts to resolve approvers by name.

For example, let's say your package is named `evaltools` and has this structure:

```
evaltools/
  approvers.py
  _registry.py
pyproject.toml
```

The `_registry.py` file serves a place to import things that you wan't registered with Inspect. For example:

```{.python filename="_registry.py"}
from .approvers import auto_approver
```

You can then register your `auto_approver` Inspect extension (and anyting else imported into `_registry.py`) like this in `pyproject.toml`:

::: {.panel-tabset group="entry-points"}
## Setuptools

``` toml
[project.entry-points.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```

## Poetry

``` toml
[tool.poetry.plugins.inspect_ai]
evaltools = "evaltools._registry"
```
:::

Once you've done this, you can refer to the approver within an approval policy config using its package qualified name. For example:

``` {.yaml filename="approval.yaml"}
approvers:
  - name: evaltools/auto_approver
    tools: "harmless*"
    decision: approve
```

## Storage

### Filesystems with fsspec

Datasets, prompt templates, and evaluation logs can be stored using either the local filesystem or a remote filesystem. Inspect uses the [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package to read and write files, which provides support for a wide variety of filesystems, including:

-   [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/serv-s3)
-   [Google Cloud Storage](https://gcsfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
-   [Azure Blob Storage](https://github.com/fsspec/adlfs)
-   [Azure Data Lake Storage](https://github.com/fsspec/adlfs)
-   [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/api-reference/dvcfilesystem)

Support for [Amazon S3](eval-logs.qmd#sec-amazon-s3) is built in to Inspect via the [s3fs](https://pypi.org/project/s3fs/) package. Other filesystems may require installation of additional packages. See the list of [built in filesystems](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#built-in-implementations) and [other known implementations](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#other-known-implementations) for all supported storage back ends.

See [Custom Filesystems](#sec-custom-filesystems) below for details on implementing your own fsspec compatible filesystem as a storage back-end.

### Filesystem Functions

The following Inspect API functions use **fsspec**:

-   `resource()` for reading prompt templates and other supporting files.

-   `csv_dataset()` and `json_dataset()` for reading datasets (note that `files` referenced within samples can also use fsspec filesystem references).

-   `list_eval_logs()` , `read_eval_log()`, `write_eval_log()`, and `retryable_eval_logs()`.

For example, to use S3 you would prefix your paths with `s3://`:

``` python
# read a prompt template from s3
prompt_template("s3://inspect-prompts/ctf.txt")

# read a dataset from S3
csv_dataset("s3://inspect-datasets/ctf-12.csv")

# read eval logs from S3
list_eval_logs("s3://my-s3-inspect-log-bucket")
```

### Custom Filesystems {#sec-custom-filesystems}

See the fsspec [developer documentation](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html) for details on implementing a custom filesystem. Note that if your implementation is *only* for use with Inspect, you need to implement only the subset of the fsspec API used by Inspect. The properties and methods used by Inspect include:

-   `sep`
-   `open()`
-   `makedirs()`
-   `info()`
-   `created()`
-   `exists()`
-   `ls()`
-   `walk()`
-   `unstrip_protocol()`
-   `invalidate_cache()`

As with Model APIs and Sandbox Environments, fsspec filesystems should be registered using a [setuptools entry point](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html). For example, if your package is named `evaltools` and you have implemented a `myfs://` filesystem using the `MyFs` class exported from the root of the package, you would register it like this in `pyproject.toml`:

::: {.panel-tabset group="entry-points"}
## Setuptools

``` toml
[project.entry-points."fsspec.specs"]
myfs = "evaltools:MyFs"
```

## Poetry

``` toml
[tool.poetry.plugins."fsspec.specs"]
myfs = "evaltools:MyFs"
```
:::

Once this package is installed, you'll be able to use `myfs://` with Inspect without any further registration.
