- Enable the user to specify scanners as dict or maybe as a name,scanner tuple or maybe scanner_with(scanner, name="").
- Each input atom has row w/ requisite ids:
    - eval_set_id
    - eval_id
    - sample_id
    - message_id / event_id
    result_dir="./scans" | None
    result_file="{scan_timestamp}_{scan_name}_{scan_id}/{scannner_name}.parquet"
    result_col=["eval_id", "task_name", "model_name", "sample_id", "message_id", "event_id"]

def scan_results(scan_id, "reward_hacking") -> pd.DataFrame:
