title: Early Stopping
---

## Overview

Early stopping enables you to skip samples or epochs during evaluation based on results observed so far. This is useful for implementing [adaptive testing algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing) that dynamically decide which samples to run based on prior performance, potentially saving significant computation time while maintaining evaluation quality.

Common use cases include:

- **Stopping a sample after consistent results**: If a sample has been answered correctly (or incorrectly) across multiple epochs, skip remaining epochs.
- **Adaptive difficulty**: Focus evaluation time on samples near the model's capability boundary.
- **Resource optimization**: Skip samples that are unlikely to provide additional signal.

## EarlyStopping Protocol

To implement early stopping, create a class that implements the `EarlyStopping` protocol and pass it to the `early_stopping` parameter of a `Task`:

```python
from inspect_ai import Task, task
from inspect_ai.util import EarlyStopping, EarlyStop

@task
def my_task():
    return Task(
        dataset=my_dataset,
        solver=my_solver,
        scorer=my_scorer,
        early_stopping=MyEarlyStopping(),
        epochs=5,
    )
```

The `EarlyStopping` protocol defines four async methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `start_task()` | Called at the beginning of an eval to register task metadata. |
| `schedule_sample()` | Called before each sample runs; return `EarlyStop` to skip it. |
| `complete_sample()` | Called when a sample completes with its scores. |
| `complete_task()` | Called when the task completes; return metadata for the log. |

## Example Implementation

Here is a simple example that randomly stops samples early (for demonstration purposes):

```python
from pydantic import JsonValue
from typing_extensions import override

from inspect_ai.dataset import Sample
from inspect_ai.log import EvalSpec
from inspect_ai.scorer import SampleScore
from inspect_ai.util import EarlyStopping, EarlyStop

class RandomEarlyStopping(EarlyStopping):
    @override
    async def start_task(
        self, task: EvalSpec, samples: list[Sample], epochs: int
    ) -> str:
        """Task initialization."""

        # TODO: create a structure to track all of the samples/epochs
        # this will generally be updated w/ scores in complete_sample() 

        # return task name
        return "random"

    @override
    async def schedule_sample(
        self, id: str | int, epoch: int
    ) -> EarlyStop | None:
        """Return EarlyStop to skip this sample, or None to run it."""

        # TODO: determine whether the given sample has been run based
        # on the previously accumulated samples scores.

        # randomly stop some samples
        if random() < 0.5:
            return EarlyStop(id=id, epoch=epoch, reason="random stop")

        return None

    @override
    async def complete_sample(
        self, id: str | int, epoch: int, scores: dict[str, SampleScore]
    ) -> None:
        """Process results from a completed sample."""

        # TODO: track scored samples and use this to determine the
        # appropriate return value for calls to schedule_sample()

        pass

    @override
    async def complete_task(self) -> dict[str, JsonValue]:
        """Return custom metadata to record in the eval log."""

        # TODO: return any custom data about the early stopping output
        # (will be written to the log and displayed in the viewer)

        return {}
```

## EarlyStop

When `schedule_sample()` returns an `EarlyStop`, the sample is skipped. The `EarlyStop` class includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `str | int` | Sample dataset id. |
| `epoch` | `int` | Sample epoch. |
| `reason` | `str | None` | Optional reason for the early stop. |
| `metadata` | `dict[str, JsonValue] | None` | Optional metadata about the stop. |

## Log Output

Early stopping information is recorded in the eval log as an `EarlyStoppingSummary`, which includes:

- The name of the early stopping manager
- A list of all samples that were stopped early
- Any metadata returned by `complete_task()`

This allows you to analyze and audit the early stopping behavior after evaluation completes.
