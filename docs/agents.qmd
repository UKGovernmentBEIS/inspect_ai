title: Using Agents
---

## Overview

Agents combine planning, memory, and tool usage to pursue more complex, longer horizon tasks (e.g. a Capture the Flag challenge). Inspect supports a variety of approaches to agent evaluations, including:

1.  Using Inspect's built-in [ReAct Agent](react-agent.qmd).

2.  Implementing a fully [Custom Agent](agent-custom.qmd).

3.  Composing agents into [Multi Agent](multi-agent.qmd) architectures.

4.  Integrating external frameworks via the [Agent Bridge](agent-bridge.qmd).

5.  Using the [Human Agent](human-agent.qmd) for human baselining of computing tasks.

Below, we'll cover the basic role and function of agents in Inspect. Subsequent articles provide more details on the ReAct agent, custom agents, and multi-agent systems.

If you are looking for state of the art software engineering agents, check out the [Inspect SWE](https://meridianlabs-ai.github.io/inspect_swe/) package which makes Claude Code and Codex CLI available as standard Inspect agents. 


## Agent Basics

The Inspect `Agent` protocol enables the creation of agent components that can be flexibly used in a wide variety of contexts. Agents are similar to solvers, but use a narrower interface that makes them much more versatile. A single agent can be:

1.  Used as a top-level `Solver` for a task.

2.  Run as a standalone operation in an agent workflow.

3.  Delegated to in a multi-agent architecture.

4.  Provided as a standard `Tool` to a model

The agents module includes a flexible, general-purpose [react agent](react-agent.qmd), which can be used standalone or to orchestrate a [multi agent](#multi-agent) system.

### Example

The following is a simple `web_surfer()` agent that uses the `web_search()` tool to do open-ended web research.

``` python
from inspect_ai.agent import Agent, AgentState, agent
from inspect_ai.model import ChatMessageSystem, get_model
from inspect_ai.tool import web_search

@agent
def web_surfer() -> Agent:
    async def execute(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        """Web research assistant."""
      
        # some general guidance for the agent
        state.messages.append(
            ChatMessageSystem(
                content="You are an expert at using a " + 
                "web browser to answer questions."
            )
        )

        # run a tool loop w/ the web_search tool 
        messages, output = await get_model().generate_loop(
            state.messages, tools=[web_search()]
        )

        # update and return state
        state.output = output
        state.messages.extend(messages)
        return state

    return execute
```

The agent calls the `generate_loop()` function which runs the model in a loop until it stops calling tools. In this case the model may make several calls to the [web_search()](https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tools-standard#sec-web-search) tool to fulfil the request.

While this example illustrates the basic mechanic of agents, you generally wouldn't write a custom agent that does only this (a system prompt with a tool use loop) as the `react()` agent provides a more sophisticated and flexible version of this pattern. Here is the equivalent `react()` agent:

``` python
from inspect_ai.agent import Agent, agent, react
from inspect_ai.tool import web_search

@agent
def web_surfer() -> Agent:
    return react(
        name="web_surfer",
        description="Web research assistant",
        prompt="You are an expert at using a " + 
            "web browser to answer questions.",
        tools=[web_search()]
    )
```

See the [ReAct Agent](react-agent.qmd) article for more details on using and customizing ReAct agents.

### Using Agents {#using-agents}

Agents can be used in the following ways:

1.  Agents can be passed as a `Solver` to any Inspect interface that takes a solver:

    ``` python
    from inspect_ai import eval

    eval("research_bench", solver=web_surfer())
    ```

    For other interfaces that aren't aware of agents, you can use the `as_solver()` function to convert an agent to a solver.

2.  Agents can be executed directly using the `run()` function (you might do this in a multi-step agent workflow):

    ``` python
    from inspect_ai.agent import run

    state = await run(
        web_surfer(), "What were the 3 most popular movies of 2020?"
    )
    print(f"The most popular movies were: {state.output.completion}")
    ```


3.  Agents can be used as a standard tool using the `as_tool()` function:

    ``` python
    from inspect_ai.agent import as_tool
    from inspect_ai.solver import use_tools, generate

    eval(
        task="research_bench", 
        solver=[
            use_tools(as_tool(web_surfer())),
            generate()
        ]
    )
    print(f"The most popular movies were: {state.output.completion}")
    ```

4.  Agents can participate in multi-agent systems where the conversation history is shared across agents. Use the `handoff()` function to create a tool that enables handing off the conversation from one agent to another:

    ``` python
    from inspect_ai.agent import handoff
    from inspect_ai.solver import use_tools, generate
    from math_tools import addition

    eval(
        task="research_bench", 
        solver=[
            use_tools(addition(), handoff(web_surfer())),
            generate()
        ]
    )
    ```

    The difference between `handoff()` and `as_tool()` is that `handoff()` forwards the entire conversation history to the agent (and enables the agent to add entries to it) whereas `as_tool()` provides a simple string in, string out interface to the agent.
