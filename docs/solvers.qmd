# Solvers {#sec-solvers}

## Overview

Solvers are the heart of Inspect evaluations and can serve a wide variety of purposes, including:

1.  Providing system prompts
2.  Prompt engineering (e.g. chain of thought)
3.  Model generation
4.  Self critique
5.  Multi-turn dialog
6.  Running an agent scaffold

Here's an example task definition that composes a few standard solvers into a plan:

``` python
@task
def theory_of_mind():
    return Task(
        dataset=json_dataset("theory_of_mind.jsonl"),
        plan=[
            system_message("system.txt"),
            chain_of_thought(),
            generate(),
            self_critique()
        ],
        scorer=model_graded_fact(),
    )
```

Typically, a call to `generate()` is included in the list of solvers (this solver is just a simple call to the model). You can also create a more sophisticated solver that calls `generate()` internally, perhaps even more than once (this is often required for more complex evaluations). Next, we'll describe how solvers operate on *task states* to do their work.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
The concept of using solvers and task states for evals was originally introduced in [OpenAI Evals](https://github.com/openai/evals/blob/main/evals/solvers/README.md). Inspect solvers are an evolution of this core design.

## Task States

Before we get into the specifics of how solvers work, we should describe `TaskState`, which is the fundamental data structure they act upon. A `TaskState` consists principally of chat history (derived from `input` and then extended by model interactions) and model output:

``` python
class TaskState:
    messages: list[ChatMessage],
    output: ModelOutput
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Note that the `TaskState` definition above is simplified: there are other fields in a `TaskState` but we're excluding them here for clarity.
:::

A prompt engineering solver will modify the content of `messages`. A model generation solver will call the model, append an assistant `message`, and set the `output` (a multi-turn dialog solver might do this in a loop).

## Solver Function

We've covered the role of solvers in the system, but what exactly are solvers technically? A solver is a Python function that takes a `TaskState` and `generate` function, and then transforms and returns the `TaskState` (the `generate` function may or may not be called depending on the solver).

``` python
async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):
    # do something useful with state (possibly
    # calling generate for more advanced solvers)
    # then return the state
    return state
```

The `generate` function passed to solvers is a convenience function that takes a `TaskState`, calls the model with it, appends the assistant message, and sets the model output. This is never used by prompt engineering solvers and nearly always used by more complex solvers that want to have multiple model interactions.

Here are what some of the built-in solvers do with the `TaskState`:

1.  The `system_message()` solver inserts a system message into the chat history.

2.  The `chain_of_thought()` solver takes the original user prompt and re-writes it to ask the model to use chain of thought reasoning to come up with its answer.

3.  The `generate()` solver just calls the `generate` function on the `state`. In fact, this is the full source code for the `generate()` solver:

    ``` python
    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):
        return await generate(state)
    ```

4.  The `self_critique()` solver takes the `ModelOutput` and then sends it to another model for critique. It then replays this critique back within the `messages` stream and re-calls `generate` to get a refined answer.

You can also imagine solvers that call other models to help come up with a better prompt, or solvers that implement a multi-turn dialog. Anything you can imagine is possible.

## Built-In Solvers

Inspect has a number of built-in solvers, each of which can be customised in some fashion. Built in solvers can be imported from the `inspect_ai.solver` module. Below is a summary of these solvers. There is not (yet) reference documentation on these functions so the best way to learn about how they can be customised, etc. is to use the **Go to Definition** command in your source editor.

-   `system_message()`

    Prepend role="system" `message` to the list of messages (will follow any other system messages it finds in the message stream).

-   `prompt_template()`

    Modify the user prompt by substituting the current prompt into the `{prompt}` placeholder within the specified template, as well as any other custom named placeholder passed in `params`.

-   `chain_of_thought()`

    Standard chain of thought template with `{prompt}` substitution variable. Asks the model to provide the final answer on a line by itself at the end for easier scoring.

-   `generate()`

    As illustrated above, just a simple call to `generate(state)`. This is the default solver if no `plan` is specified.

-   `multiple_choice()`

    A solver which presents A,B,C,D style `choices` from input samples (in a random order), calls `generate()` to yield model output, then maps the answer back to the correct index for scoring. Note that you don't need to call `generate()` separately when using this solver.

-   `self_critique()`

    Prompts the model to critique the results of a previous call to `generate()` (note that this need not be the same model as they one you are evaluating—use the `model` parameter to choose another model). Makes use of `{question}` and `{completion}` template variables.

-   `use_tools()`

    Define the set tools available for use by the model during `generate()`.

### Multiple Choice

Here is the declaration for the `multiple_choice()` solver:

``` python
def multiple_choice(
    multiple_correct: bool = False,
    shuffle: bool | Random = False,
    template: str | None = None,
) -> Solver:
```

By default, multiple choice questions have a single correct answer. Set `multiple_correct=True` if your target has defined multiple correct answers (for example, a `target` of `["B", "C"]`). In this case the model is prompted to provide one or more answers, and the sample is scored correct only if each of these answers are provided.

If you specify `shuffle=True`, then the order of the answers presented to the model will be randomised (this may or may not affect results, depending on the nature of the questions and the model being evaluated).

Use `template` to provide an alternate prompt template (note that if you do this your template should handle prompting for `multiple_correct` directly if required).

When using the `multiple_choice()` solver you should always pair it with the `choice()` scorer.

### Self Critique

Here is the declaration for the `self_critique()` solver:

``` python
def self_critique(
    critique_template: str | None = None,
    completion_template: str | None = None,
    model: str | Model | None = None,
) -> Solver:
```

There are two templates which correspond to the one used to solicit critique and the one used to play that critique back for a refined answer (default templates are provided for both).

You will likely want to experiment with using a distinct `model` for generating critiques (by default the model being evaluated is used).

## Custom Solvers

In this section we'll take a look at the source code for a couple of the built in solvers as a jumping off point for implementing your own solvers. A solver is an implementation of the `Solver` protocol (a function that transforms a `TaskState`):

``` python
async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -> TaskState:
    # do something useful with state, possibly calling generate()
    # for more advanced solvers
    return state
```

Typically solvers can be customised with parameters (e.g. `template` for prompt engineering solvers). This means that a `Solver` is actually a function which returns the `solve()` function referenced above (this will become more clear in the examples below).

### Task States

Before presenting the examples we'll take a more in-depth look at the `TaskState` class. Task states consist of both lower level data members (e.g. `messages`, `output`) as well as a number of convenience properties. The core members of `TaskState` that are *modified* by solvers are `messages` / `user_prompt` and `output`:

| Member | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `messages` | list\[ChatMessage\] | Chat conversation history for sample. It is automatically appended to by the `generate()` solver, and is often manipulated by other solvers (e.g. for prompt engineering or elicitation). |
| `user_prompt` | ChatMessageUser | Convenience property for accessing the first user message in the message history (commonly used for prompt engineering). |
| `output` | ModelOutput | The 'final' model output once we've completed all solving. This field is automatically updated with the last "assistant" message by the `generate()` solver. |

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Note that the `generate()` solver automatically updates both the `messages` and `output` fields. For very simple evaluations modifying the `user_prompt` and then calling `generate()` encompasses all of the required interaction with `TaskState`.
:::

There are two additional fields that solvers might modify (but they are typically for more advanced use cases):

| Member | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `metadata` | dict | Original metadata from `Sample`, as well as any other custom metadata that solvers choose to write (typically used to coordinate between solvers and/or for custom logging). |
| `completed` | bool | Solvers can set `completed = True` to cause the task to exit the plan immediately. |

Sometimes its import to have access to the *original* prompt input for the task (as other solvers may have re-written or even removed it entirely). This is available using the `input` and `input_text` properties:

| Member | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `input` | str \| list\[ChatMessage\] | Original `Sample` input. |
| `input_text` | str | Convenience function for accessing the initial input from the `Sample` as a string. |

There are several other fields used to provide contextual data from either the task sample or evaluation:

| Member | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `sample_id` | int \| str | Unique ID for sample. |
| `epoch` | int | Epoch for sample. |
| `choices` | list\[str\] \| None | Choices from sample (used only in multiple-choice evals). |
| `model` | ModelName | Name of model currently being evaluated. |

Finally, task states also include available tools as well as guidance for the model on which tools to use (if you haven't yet encountered the concept of tool use in language models, don't worry about understanding these fields, the [Tools](tools.qmd) article provides a more in-depth treatment):

| Member | Type | Description |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `tools` | list\[Tool\] | Tools available to the model |
| `tool_choice` | ToolChoice | Tool choice directive. |
| `tool_calls_pending` | bool | Convenience property for determining whether the last assistant message includes unresolved tool calls. |

These fields are typically modified via the `use_tools()` solver, but they can also be modified directly for more advanced use cases.

### Example: Prompt Template

Here's the code for the `prompt_template()` solver:

``` python
@solver
def prompt_template(template: str, **params: dict[str, Any]):

    # determine the prompt template
    prompt_template = resource(template)

    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -> TaskState:
        # its possible the messages payload has no user prompt
        # so only modify the prompt if there is one
        if state.user_prompt:
            state.user_prompt.text = prompt_template.format(
                prompt=state.user_prompt.text, **params
            )
        return state

    return solve
```

A few things to note about this implementation:

1.  The function applies the `@solver` decorator—this registers the `Solver` with Inspect, making it possible to capture its name and parameters for logging, as well as make it callable from a configuration file (e.g. a YAML specification of an eval).

2.  The `solve()` function is declared as `async`. This is so that it can participate in Inspect's optimised scheduling for expensive model generation calls (this solver doesn't call `generate()` but others will).

3.  The `resource()` function is used to read the specified `template`. This function accepts a string, file, or URL as its argument, and then returns a string with the contents of the resource.

4.  We make use of the `user_prompt` property on the `TaskState`. This is a convenience property for locating the first `role="user"` message (otherwise you might need to skip over system messages, etc). Since this is a string templating solver, we use the `state.user_prompt.text` property (so we are dealing with prompt as a string, recall that it can also be a list of messages).

### Example: Self Critique

Here's the code for the `self_critique()` solver:

``` python
DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE = r"""
Given the following question and answer, please critique the answer.
A good answer comprehensively answers the question and NEVER refuses
to answer. If the answer is already correct do not provide critique
- simply respond 'The original answer is fully correct'.

[BEGIN DATA]
***
[Question]: {question}
***
[Answer]: {completion}
***
[END DATA]

Critique: """

DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE = r"""
Given the following question, initial answer and critique please
generate an improved answer to the question:

[BEGIN DATA]
***
[Question]: {question}
***
[Answer]: {completion}
***
[Critique]: {critique}
***
[END DATA]

If the original answer is already correct, just repeat the
original answer exactly. You should just provide your answer to
the question in exactly this format:

Answer: <your answer> """

@solver
def self_critique(
    critique_template: str | None = None,
    completion_template: str | None = None,
    model: str | Model | None = None,
) -> Solver:
    # resolve templates
    critique_template = resource(
        critique_template or DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_TEMPLATE
    )
    completion_template = resource(
        completion_template or DEFAULT_CRITIQUE_COMPLETION_TEMPLATE
    )

    # resolve critique model
    model = get_model(model)

    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate) -> TaskState:
        # run critique
        critique = await model.generate(
            critique_template.format(
                question=state.input_text,
                completion=state.output.completion,
            )
        )

        # add the critique as a user message
        state.messages.append(
            ChatMessageUser(
                content=completion_template.format(
                    question=state.input_text,
                    completion=state.output.completion,
                    critique=critique.completion,
                ),
            )
        )

        # regenerate
        return await generate(state)

    return solve
```

Note that calls to `generate()` (for both the critique model and the model being evaluated) are called with `await`—this is critical to ensure that the solver participates correctly in the scheduling of generation work.

### Concurrency

When creating custom solvers, it's critical that you understand Inspect's concurrency model. More specifically, if your solver is doing non-trivial work (e.g. calling REST APIs, executing external processes, etc.) please review [Eval Tuning](#sec-eval-tuning) for a more in depth discussion.

## Early Termination

In some cases a solver has the context available to request an early termination of the plan (i.e. don't call the rest of the solvers). In this case, setting the `TaskState.completed` field will result in forgoing remaining solvers in the plan. For example, here's a simple solver that terminates the plan early:

``` python
@solver
def complete_task():
    async def solve(state: TaskState, generate: Generate):
        state.completed = True
        return state

    return solve
```

Early termination might also occur if you specify the `max_messages` option and the conversation exceeds that limit:

``` python
# could terminate early
eval(my_task, max_messages = 10)
```

In cases of early termination, you might have one final Solver that you want to make sure to always run (e.g. to synthesize an output for an early termination or to cleanup resources allocated for an evaluation). In this case, use a `Plan` object with a `finish` Solver:

``` python
Task(
    dataset=json_dataset("data.json"),
    plan = Plan(
        steps = [...],
        finish = finish_up()
    ),
    scorer = model_graded_fact()
)
```

In this example the `finish_up()` solver will always be called even if the plan doesn't run all of its steps.

## Plan Cleanup

If your solvers allocate resources (for example, run a Docker container or mount a drive), you will want to make sure that these resources are cleaned up even in the case of an error occurring during the evaluation. To arrange for this, use a `Plan` object with a `cleanup` function:

``` python

async def cleanup(state):
    # cleanup resources
    ...

Task(
    dataset=json_dataset("data.json"),
    plan = Plan(
        steps = [...],
        cleanup = cleanup
    ),
    scorer = model_graded_fact()
)
```

In this example the `cleanup()` function will always be called even if an error occurs during evaluation. Note that the cleanup handler must be declared as an `async` function.
