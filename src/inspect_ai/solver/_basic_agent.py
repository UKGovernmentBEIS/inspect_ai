    """Basic ReAct agent.

    Agent that runs a tool use loop until the model submits an answer using the
    `submit()` tool. Tailor the model's instructions by passing a `system_message()`
    and/or other steps to `init` (if no `init` is specified then a default system
    message will be used). Use `max_attempts` to support additional submissions if
    the initial submission(s) are incorrect.

    Submissions are evaluated using the task's main scorer, with value of 1.0
    indicating a correct answer. Scorer values are converted to float (e.g.
    "C" becomes 1.0) using the standard value_to_float() function. Provide an
    alternate conversion scheme as required via `score_value`.

    Args:
       init: (Solver | list[Solver] | None): Agent initialisation
         (defaults to system_message with basic ReAct prompt)
       tools (list[Tool | ToolDef] | Solver | None): Tools available for the agent. Either a
         list of tools or a Solver that can yield dynamic tools per-sample.
       cache: (bool | CachePolicy): Caching behaviour for generate responses
         (defaults to no caching).
       max_attempts (int): Maximum number of submissions to accept before terminating.
       message_limit (int | None): Limit on messages in sample before terminating agent.
          If not specified, will use limit_messages defined for the task. If there is none
          defined for the task, 50 will be used as a default.
       token_limit (int | None): Limit on tokens used in sample before terminating agent.
       score_value (ValueToFloat): Function used to extract float from scores (defaults
         to standard value_to_float())
       incorrect_message (str | Callable[[TaskState, list[Score]], str]): User message reply for an
         incorrect submission from the model. Alternatively, a function which returns a message.
       continue_message (str): User message to urge the model to continue when it
         doesn't make a tool call.
       submit_name (str): Name for tool used to make submissions
        (defaults to 'submit')
       submit_description (str): Description of submit tool (defaults to
        'Submit an answer for evaluation')
       **kwargs (Any): Deprecated arguments for backward compatibility.
