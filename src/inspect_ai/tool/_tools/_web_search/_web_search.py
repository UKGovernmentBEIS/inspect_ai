    """Web search tool.

    A tool that can be registered for use by models to search the web. Use
    the `use_tools()` solver to make the tool available (e.g.
    `use_tools(web_search(provider="tavily"))`))

    A web search is conducted using the specified provider.
    - When using Tavily, all logic for relevance and summarization is handled by
    the Tavily API.
    - When using Google, the results are parsed for relevance using the specified
    model, and the top 'num_results' relevant pages are returned.

    See further documentation at <https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tools-standard.html#sec-web-search>.

    Args:
      provider: Search provider to use:
        - "tavily": Uses Tavily's Research API.
        - "google": Uses Google Custom Search.
        Note: The `| None` type is only for backwards compatibility. Passing
        `None` is deprecated.
      num_results: The number of search result pages used to provide information
      back to the model.
      max_provider_calls: Maximum number of search calls to make to the search
      provider.
      max_connections: Maximum number of concurrent connections to API endpoint
      of search provider.
      model: Model used to parse web pages for relevance - used only by the
      `google` provider.

    Returns:
       A tool that can be registered for use by models to search the web.
