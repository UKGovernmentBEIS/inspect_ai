    """Interactive bash shell session tool.

    Interact with a bash shell in a long running session using a sandbox
    environment (e.g. "docker"). This tool allows sending text to the shell,
    which could be a command followed by a newline character or any other input
    text such as the response to a password prompt.

    To create a separate bash process for each
    call to `bash_session()`, pass a unique value for `instance`

    See complete documentation at <https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/tools-standard.html#sec-bash-session>.

    Args:
      timeout: Timeout (in seconds) for command.
      wait_for_output: Maximum time (in seconds) to wait for output. If no
          output is received within this period, the function will return an
          empty string. The model may need to make multiple tool calls to obtain
          all output from a given command.

      instance: Instance id (each unique instance id has its own bash process)

        Interact with a bash shell.

        Interact with a bash shell by sending it input text and retrieving output
        from it. There is no guarantee that all output will be returned in a
        single call. Call this function multiple times to retrieve additional
        output from the shell.

        USAGE NOTES:
        - Ensure that the shell is at a command prompt (typically when the
          output ends in "$ " or "# ") before submitting a new command.
        - Control characters must be sent as Unicode escape sequences (e.g., use
          "\u0003" for Ctrl+C/ETX, "\u0004" for Ctrl+D/EOT). The literal string
          "Ctrl+C" will not be interpreted as a control character.
        - Use the "read" action to retrieve output from the shell without
          sending any input. This is useful for long-running commands that
          produce output over time. The "read" action will return any new output
          since the last call.
        - If a long-running command is in progress, additional input to execute
          a new command will not be processed until the previous completes. To
          abort a long-running command, use the "interrupt" action:
          `bash_session(action="interrupt")`

        Example use case:
        - For a short-running command with a nominal amount of output, a single
          call may suffice.
          ```
          bash_session(action="type_submit", input="echo foo") -> "foo\nuser@host:/# "
          ```
        - For a long-running command with output over time, multiple calls to are needed.
          ```
          bash_session(action="type_submit", input="tail -f /tmp/foo.log") -> <some output>
          bash_session(action="read") -> <more output>
          # Send interrupt (Ctrl+C)
          bash_session(action="interrupt") -> "<final output>^Cuser@host:/# "
          ```
        - Interactive command awaiting more input from the user.
          ```
          bash_session(action="type_submit", input="ssh fred@foo.com") -> "foo.com's password: "
          bash_session(action="type_submit", input="secret") -> "fred@foo.com:~$ "
          ```

        Args:
          action: The action to execute:
                - "type": Send input without a return key
                - "type_submit": Send input followed by a return key
                - "read": Read any new output without sending input
                - "interrupt": Send a Ctrl+C (ETX character) to interrupt the current process
                - "restart": Restart the bash session
          input: The input to send to the shell.
                Required for "type". Optional for "type_submit" actions. Must
                not be provided for "restart", "read", or "interrupt" actions.
