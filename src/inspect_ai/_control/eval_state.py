"""Process-level per-eval state aggregate.

Tracks running totals across the samples of each in-flight eval
(``eval_id``-keyed). Consumed by the control-channel ``GET /evals``
endpoint to surface counts that ``active_samples()`` alone can't
provide.

The eval runner calls :func:`register_eval` at task start (when the
total sample count is known) and :func:`unregister_eval` at task end,
plus :func:`record_sample_completed` / :func:`record_sample_errored`
at each sample's terminal outcome.

Lives under ``_control/`` because the control channel is currently
the only consumer; if other surfaces (TUI, view server) ever need
process-level eval counters, this can move up.

Why a counter aggregate rather than computing on demand from
``active_samples()``:

- ``active_samples`` carries only currently-registered samples;
  completed ones are removed, so we can't count them.
- The total sample count is known at task start but isn't otherwise
  available from the sample-level state.
- A running counter is cheap and updated at well-defined transition
  points, vs. polling derived state from elsewhere.
