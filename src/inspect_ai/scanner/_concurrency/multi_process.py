"""Multi-process work pool implementation for scanner operations.

This module provides a process-based concurrency strategy using fork-based
ProcessPoolExecutor. Each worker process runs its own async event loop with
multiple concurrent tasks, allowing efficient parallel execution of scanner work.

Note: multiprocessing.Queue.get() is blocking with no async support, so we use
anyio.to_thread.run_sync to wrap .get() calls to prevent blocking the event loop.
Queue.put() on unbounded queues (our case) only blocks briefly for lock contention,
so threading is unnecessary.
