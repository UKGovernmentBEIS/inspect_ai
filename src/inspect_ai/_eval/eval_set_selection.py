"""Eval-set selection (worker) mode.

When the `INSPECT_EVAL_SET_SELECTION` environment variable names a JSON file
containing an `EvalSetSelection`, `eval_set()` resolves its tasks normally and
then runs only the selected ones through the ordinary `eval()` path, skipping
all eval-set orchestration (log directory scanning, `.eval-set-id`,
`eval-set.json`, `logs.json`, retry partitioning, and log cleanup).

This is the execution counterpart to capture mode (see `eval_set_manifest.py`).
An external runner first enumerates an eval set with
`INSPECT_EVAL_SET_CAPTURE`, then launches one worker per task with
`INSPECT_EVAL_SET_SELECTION`, naming tasks by the `identifier` values from the
capture manifest. Because a worker performs no eval-set bookkeeping, many
workers can write into a single flat log directory concurrently: each writes
exactly one (atomically replaced) `.eval` file, and the runner is the sole
writer of the directory's eval-set metadata.

The definition still calls `eval_set()` — that is what preserves the side
effects of executing it (registered models, `set_model_info`, dynamically
constructed `Model` objects) in every worker process.

Two of the definition's options are overridden in worker mode, because both
are completion decisions that belong to the runner rather than the worker:
`fail_on_error` is forced to `False` (so sample errors never fail a task —
the runner sees them in the log and decides what to do) and task-level retry
is disabled (the runner retries by respawning a worker with `resume`, and an
in-process loop would multiply its attempt budget and leave a failed log per
attempt in the shared directory). `continue_on_fail` needs no override: it is
moot once `fail_on_error` is `False`. Everything else the definition set is
honoured, `retry_on_error` in particular — sample-level retry stays under the
definition author's control. The values the definition asked for are recorded
in the capture manifest's `options`, so a runner can see what it is honouring
and what is being overridden.

This module is deliberately not part of the public API: the models here are a
versioned wire format (see `EVAL_SET_SELECTION_VERSION`) written by external
runners (currently inspect_steward, which imports them from this module).
Schema changes require a version bump and corresponding golden-test updates
(see `tests/test_eval_set_selection.py`).
