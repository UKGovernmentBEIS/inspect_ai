    ::: callout-note
    The `collect()` function described below is available only in the development version of Inspect. To install the development version from GitHub:

    ``` bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/UKGovernmentBEIS/inspect_ai
    ```
    :::

    Similar to [`asyncio.gather()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.gather),
    but also works when [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the async backend.

    Automatically includes each task in a `span()`, which
    ensures that its events are grouped together in the transcript.

    Using `collect()` in preference to `asyncio.gather()` is highly recommended
    for both Trio compatibility and more legible transcript output.

    Args:
        *tasks: Tasks to run

    Returns:
        List of task results.
