# TODO: The playwright package includes some .sh scripts - e.g. reinstall_chrome_beta_linux.sh
# staticx naÃ¯vely treats any executable file as an ELF file. Of course, .sh files
# are not. Unfortunately, there's no trivial way to tell staticx to only process
# true ELF files. The proposed solution is to strip +x from those files' permissions.
# That seems silly. If we're willing to -X them, why include them at all? Some
# suggest implementing a python PyInstall hook to filter them out.
